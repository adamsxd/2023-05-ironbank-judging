# Precision loss in `TripleSlopeRateModel.sol`

## Summary
The `getBorrowRate` and `getSupplyRate` functions use the result of `getUtilization` in their computations. Any precision loss from `getUtilization` will propagate to these functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the code from `getBorrowRate()` function, if we look at the case where utilization rate is less than or equal to kink1
```solidity
return baseBorrowPerSecond + (utilization * borrowPerSecond1) / 1e18;
```
The utilization is first multiplied with borrowPerSecond1. This product is then divided by 1e18.
The getUtilization function computes the utilization rate as (borrow * 1e18) / (cash + borrow). 
In Solidity, it could lead to loss of precision because the division of integers in Solidity always rounds down to the nearest integer.

When this utilization rate, which might already have some precision loss, is multiplied with borrowPerSecond1 and then divided by 1e18 again, it could introduce further precision loss

This issue exists in all three conditions in the `getBorrowRate` function, and also when calculating the supply rate in the `getSupplyRate` function.

## Impact
If the values of cash and borrow are large enough, these rounding errors might become less significant. But for smaller values, or over many repeated calculations, these errors could accumulate and become noticeable.
