# MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS cannot be minimum

## Summary
The variable MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS is set in the contracts, but it is not treated as a minimum value where it is used.

## Vulnerability Detail
Despite being configured as 100% (10000) for the minimum value, it can only be set from 100.01% (10001), resulting in an implementation that differs from its actual usage.

## Impact
Since the implementation differs from the specifications, it may cause some problems when actually executed.

## Code Snippet

```

use `>=` instead of `>`
```diff
--     liquidationBonus > MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS && liquidationBonus <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_BONUS,
++    liquidationBonus >= MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS && liquidationBonus <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_BONUS,
```

```diff
--    liquidationBonus > MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS && liquidationBonus <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_BONUS,
++   liquidationBonus >= MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS && liquidationBonus <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_BONUS,
