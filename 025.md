# `liquidationBonus` with a minimum value of `MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS` will always revert

## Summary

`liquidationBonus` with a minimum value of 100% will always revert

## Vulnerability Detail

In `MarketConfigurator.sol` we have `configureMarketAsCollateral` and `adjustMarketLiquidationBonus()` functions.  The first function allows the owner to configure a market as collateral and the second is to adjust the liquidation bonus of a market.
The problem here is that both functions will revert when the minimum allowed value is set. 
The minimum allowed value is in `Constants.sol`:

```solidity
12: uint16 internal constant MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS = 10000; // 100%
```
Both Functions have the following check:

```solidity
require(
            liquidationBonus > MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS && liquidationBonus <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_BONUS,  
            "invalid liquidation bonus"
        );
```
Оmitted is to add the sign greater than or equal to.

As you can see the function will not allow to set the `liquidationBonus` value to 100% (that is 10000).

## Impact

It is impossible to settle a liquidation bonus of 100%

## Recommendation

Change:
```solidity
liquidationBonus > MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS && liquidationBonus <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_BONUS
```

To:
```solidity
liquidationBonus >= MIN_LIQUIDATION_BONUS && liquidationBonus <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_BONUS
```
