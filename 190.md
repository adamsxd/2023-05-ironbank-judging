# Potential for Division by Zero in `getUtilization` Function


## Summary

The `getUtilization` function in the `TripleSlopeRateModel` contract may potentially lead to a division by zero error.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getUtilization` function calculates utilization using the formula `(borrow * 1e18) / (cash + borrow)`. If `cash` and `borrow` are both zero, the function could potentially lead to a division by zero error.

## Impact

If such a condition is met, it could halt the execution of a transaction interacting with the contract, thereby affecting the normal operation of the DeFi protocol.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function getUtilization(uint256 cash, uint256 borrow) public pure returns (uint256) {
    if (borrow == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return (borrow * 1e18) / (cash + borrow);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adding a check to ensure that the sum of `cash` and `borrow` is not zero would help prevent this issue. Here's how the modified code could look:
```solidity
function getUtilization(uint256 cash, uint256 borrow) public pure returns (uint256) {
    require(cash + borrow != 0, "Cash and Borrow total cannot be zero");
    if (borrow == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return (borrow * 1e18) / (cash + borrow);
}
```
Note that it's always necessary to carefully test the contract after modifying its logic, even if the modification seems minor.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy `TripleSlopeRateModel` contract on a local testnet or Ethereum mainnet fork using Hardhat or Truffle, passing appropriate parameters to the constructor.
2. Call the `getUtilization` function with both `cash` and `borrow` parameters set to zero.
3. Observe that the call fails due to the division by zero error.
