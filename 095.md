# Wrong check when repaying as a Credit Account

## Summary
According to the comment in the require function, "credit account should only be able to repay for itself". However, the logic is flawed.


## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function repay(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(from) {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
        if (isCreditAccount(to)) {
            require(from == to, "credit account can only repay for itself");
        }

        _accrueInterest(market, m);

        _repay(m, from, to, market, amount);
    }
```
With the current implementation credit accounts can repay not only for themselves, but for every other user as long as the other user isn't a credit account.
The current implementation is 'only credit account can repay for itself' contrary to the supposed 'credit account can only repay for itself'. Contrary to the statement in the code, credit accounts can repay for any non-credit accounts.


## Impact
Credit accounts can repay for non-credit accounts, even though they are not supposed to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the `from` address is a credit account instead of the `to` address
```solidity
- if (isCreditAccount(to)) {
```
```solidity
+ if (isCreditAccount(from)) {
```
