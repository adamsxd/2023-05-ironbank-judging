# TxBuilderExtension.redeemNativeToken will not redeem whole amount when user provides type(uint256).max

## Summary
TxBuilderExtension.redeemNativeToken will not redeem whole amount when user provides type(uint256).max, because it doesn't call accrueInterests before.
## Vulnerability Detail
`TxBuilderExtension.redeemNativeToken` function is used to redeem tokens from IronBank. User can provide `type(uint256).max` amount when he wants withdraw whole supply amount.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L275-L283
```solidity
    function redeemNativeToken(address user, uint256 redeemAmount) internal nonReentrant {
        if (redeemAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            redeemAmount = ironBank.getSupplyBalance(user, weth);
        }
        ironBank.redeem(user, address(this), weth, redeemAmount);
        WethInterface(weth).withdraw(redeemAmount);
        (bool sent,) = user.call{value: redeemAmount}("");
        require(sent, "failed to send native token");
    }
```

As you can see in case if `redeemAmount == type(uint256).max`, then `ironBank.getSupplyBalance` is called [to get user's underlying amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L175) that can be withdrawn. The problem here, is that interests are not accrued at this moment, which means that exchange rate can be bigger.

After that function calls `ironBank.redeem` and provide user's underying amount(without additional interests). And only then [interests will be accrued](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L414), which will increase exchange rate.

Because of that user will not withdraw whole amount as he wanted and some interests will be still remaining.
## Impact
User will not be able to withdraw whole balance, interests can be small, so user will not withdraw them as this will make him pay more on gas.

## Recommendation
You don't need to calculate it in TxBuilderExtension, as this is [already done](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L421) inside IronBank.
