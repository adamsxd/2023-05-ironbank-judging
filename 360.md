# TxBuilderExtension#redeemNativeToken fails to accrueToken before getSupplyBalance

## Summary

TxBuilderExtension#redeemNativeToken fails to accrueToken before getSupplyBalance when the user is attempting to fully redeem. This leads to funds being left in the contract that must be recovered with a subsequent transaction. On mainnet, the gas cost to recover these funds are more than they are worth leading to loss to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

[TxBuilderExtension.sol#L275-L283](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L275-L283)

    function redeemNativeToken(address user, uint256 redeemAmount) internal nonReentrant {
        if (redeemAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            redeemAmount = ironBank.getSupplyBalance(user, weth);
        }
        ironBank.redeem(user, address(this), weth, redeemAmount);
        WethInterface(weth).withdraw(redeemAmount);
        (bool sent,) = user.call{value: redeemAmount}("");
        require(sent, "failed to send native token");
    }

Above we see that ironBank.getSupplyBalance is called without first accruing interest. This leads to an out-dated supply balance and all pending interest will be left deposited to the user. While a user can recover these funds at anytime, the gas costs (especially on mainnet) to recover them can easily be larger than the amount that is left deposited. This means that the funds left deposited are economically lost to the user due to a malfunction of the smart contract.

## Impact

User funds are left deposited requiring the user to spend more in gas to recover it than it is worth

## Recommendation

Accrue interest to weth market before getting supply balance.
