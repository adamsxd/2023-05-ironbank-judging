# `IronBank.deferLiquidityCheck` can be used to drain the pool

## Summary
`deferLiquidityCheck` looks like it creates the possibility to perform actions where at then end of the transaction `_checkAccountLiquidity` needs to be stable (flash loan actions).
Due to the nature of the functions and how it handles `liquidityCheckStatus`, it can be used to redeem more than you own. 
## Vulnerability Detail
1. Attacker uses a contract and calls `supply` 100 Atoken and `borrow` 75 Btoken (assuming both tokens have a 1:1 value)
2. Calls `deferLiquidityCheck`, passes:

3. Status is now set to:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#LL521C9-L521C63
4. An external call is performed on the address `msg.sender`:

5. The attacker can do anything with this function, so calls `redeem(type(uint).max)`
6. `redeem` burns the ibTokens and sends the Atoken amount according to exchangeRate while still having 75 Btokens. 

Normally, `redeem` would obviously revert since `_checkAccountLiquidity()` is used. 
But looking at the check function, liquidity is only checked if `status == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_NORMAL`.

Since we are still in the `deferLiquidityCheck`, status = `LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DEFERRED` so this will be skipped and status is set to `liquidityCheckStatus[user] = LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DIRTY`

Returning to `deferLiquidityCheck` after `redeem` completes, status is set to normal again
