# Wrong Price will be Returned When Asset is PToken for WstETH

## Summary
Iron Bank allows a PToken market to be created for an underlying asset in addition to a lending market. PTokens can be counted as user collaterals and their price is fetched based on their underlying tokens. However, wrong price will return when PToken's underlying asset is WstETH.
## Vulnerability Detail
Retrieving price for WstETH is a 2 step process. WstETH needs to be converted to stETH first, then converted to ETH/USD. This is properly implemented when the market is WstETH through checking `if (asset==wsteth)`. But when PToken market is created for WstETH, this check will by bypassed because PToken contract address will be different from wsteth address.

PToken market price is set through `_setAggregators()` in PriceOracle.sol where base and quote token address are set and tested before writing into `aggregators` array. And note that quote token address can either be ETH or USD. When asset price is accessed through `getPrice()`, if the input asset is not `wsteth` address, `aggregators` is directly pulled to get chainlink price denominated in ETH or USD. 

```solidity
//PriceOracle.sol
//_setAggregators()
                require(
                    aggrs[i].quote == Denominations.ETH ||
                        aggrs[i].quote == Denominations.USD,
                    "unsupported quote"
                );
```
```solidity
//PriceOracle.sol
    function getPrice(address asset) external view returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == wsteth) {
            uint256 stEthPrice = getPriceFromChainlink(
                steth,
                Denominations.USD
            );
            uint256 stEthPerToken = WstEthInterface(wsteth).stEthPerToken();
            uint256 wstEthPrice = (stEthPrice * stEthPerToken) / 1e18;
            return getNormalizedPrice(wstEthPrice, asset);
        }
        AggregatorInfo memory aggregatorInfo = aggregators[asset];
        uint256 price = getPriceFromChainlink(
            aggregatorInfo.base,
            aggregatorInfo.quote
        );
       ...
```
This creates a problem for PToken for WstETH, because `if (asset==wsteth)` will be bypassed and chainlink aggregator price will be returned. And chainlink doesn't have a direct price quote of WstETH/ETH or WstETH/USD, only WstETH/stETH or stETH/USD. This means most likely aggregator price for stETH/USD will be returned as price for WstETH. 

Since stETH is a rebasing token, and WstETH:stETH is not 1 to 1, this will create a wrong valuation for users holding PToken for WstETH as collaterals. 
## Impact
Since users holding PToken for WstETH will have wrong valuation, this potentially creates opportunities for malicious over-borrowing or unfair liquidations, putting the protocol at risk.

## Recommendation
In `getPrice()`, consider adding another check whether the asset is PToken and its underlying asset is WstETH. If true, use the same bypass for pricing.
