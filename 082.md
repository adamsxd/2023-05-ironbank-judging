# No check if Arbitrum/Optimism L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
No check if Arbitrum/Optimism L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds
## Vulnerability Detail
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum and Optimism requires to check, if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.
The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.

Before request price, contract should check status of sequencer - https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds

## Impact
Users can get better borrows if the price is above the actual price or can avoid liquidations if the price is under the actual price

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommended to follow the code example of Chainlink: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code

```solidity
    // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }

        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();
        }
```
