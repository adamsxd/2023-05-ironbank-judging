# XDZIBEC-increaseObservationCardinalityNext() function does not check for negative values

## Summary
The `increaseObservationCardinalityNext()` function does not check to see if the `observationCardinalityNext` parameter is greater than or equal to the current` observationCardinality`. This means that it is possible to pass a negative value to the function, which will set the `observationCardinality` to a negative value. This will cause the `flash()` function to `fail`, which could result in financial losses by an attacker.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function flash(
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount0,
        uint256 amount1,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external;

    /// @notice Increase the maximum number of price and liquidity observations that this pool will store
    /// @dev This method is no-op if the pool already has an observationCardinalityNext greater than or equal to
    /// the input observationCardinalityNext.
    /// @param observationCardinalityNext The desired minimum number of observations for the pool to store
    function increaseObservationCardinalityNext(uint16 observationCardinalityNext) external;
}
```
The `increaseObservationCardinalityNext()` function does not check to see if the `observationCardinalityNext` parameter is greater than or equal to the current `observationCardinality`. This means that it is possible to pass a negative value to the function, which will set the `observationCardinality `to a negative value. This will cause the `flash()` function to fail, as it will try to read more bytes from the data parameter than are stored in the `observationCardinality`.

## Impact

- An attacker  could use this vulnerability to steal funds from users.
- An attacker exploit this vulnerability by :
    - An attacker could create a malicious contract that calls the `increaseObservationCardinalityNext()` function with a `negative` value.
    - This would cause the `observationCardinality` to be `set` to a negative value.
    -  When the `flash()` function is called, it will` fail`.
    - This could result in financial losses for the user who called the `flash()` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 - the `increaseObservationCardinalityNext()` function should be `updated` to check to see if the `observationCardinalityNext` parameter is greater than or equal to the current `observationCardinality`. If the parameter is not greater than or equal to the current `observationCardinality`, the function should return an` error`.
