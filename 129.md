# XDZIBEC-approve function does not validate amount parameter allow attacker to transfer tokens.

## Summary
The `approve()` function does not validate the` amount` parameter, this means that a `malicious` user could call the `approve()` function with an `amount` that is `greater` than the maximum possible value of a `uint256`, this would result in the `allowance` variable being `set` to an invalid value, which could lead to to transfer tokens from the users to an attacker.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

    /// @notice Transfers `amount` tokens from `sender` to `recipient` up to the allowance given to the `msg.sender`
    /// @param sender The account from which the transfer will be initiated
    /// @param recipient The recipient of the transfer
    /// @param amount The amount of the transfer
    /// @return Returns true for a successful transfer, false for unsuccessful
```
- There is a vulnerability in the` allowance[msg.sender] = amount`; line, the `allowance` variable is a `mapping` from addresses to `uint256` values, the value of the mapping for` msg.sender` is being set to `amount`, the `amount` parameter is not being validated. this means that a `malicious` user could call the `approve()` function with an amount that is greater than the maximum possible value of a `uint256`, this would result in the `allowance` variable being `set` to an invalid` value`, which could lead to transfer tokens from users to an attacker.
## Impact
- An attacker could  exploit contract and leading to lose token and transfer it from users to the attacker.
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability :
    - A malicious `user` creates a contract that has a function that is designed to `transfer` tokens.
    - The malicious `user` calls the `approve()` function on the contract with an `amount` that is `greater` than the `maximum` possible value of a `uint256`.
    - The `allowance` variable is `set` to an invalid value.
    - The malicious `user` then calls the function on the contract that is designed to `transfer` `tokens`.
    - The function `fails` to `transfer` the `tokens` because the allowance variable is set to an `invalid` value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-Adding a validation check to the `approve()` function, the validation check should ensure that the amount parameter is within the valid range, and to ensure ensure that the amount parameter is not greater than the maximum possible value of a `uint256`. This will prevent malicious users from exploiting the bug to set the allowance variable to an invalid value
