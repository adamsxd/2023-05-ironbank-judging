# Liquidators can be not interested in liquidation of small debts

## Summary
Liquidators can be not interested in liquidation of small debts. So this debts will remain in the protocol and will create bad debt.
## Vulnerability Detail
In order to liquidate debt position, IronBank has `liquidate` function. This function allows liquidator to provide amount he wants to liquidate on behalf of debtor.

This will be only done, when liquidation is attractive to liquidator, which means that he will earn smth from the call.
IronBank [uses `liquidationBonus`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L834) to incentivize liquidators.

But in case if the debt is too small(for example 5$), that means that it can be not attractive for the liquidator to `liquidate` debt, because he will spend more funds as gas payment than he will earn. That means that such debts usually will not liquidated and will remain in the system and create bad debt.

What is worse, is that some liquidators can liquidate accounts not fully, but leave some small amount, exactly to create bad debt, that will not be liquidated by anyone else.

I believe that this is high severity issue, because borrowers, interested repayers and liquidators can make system insolvent, which will cause stakers to redeem.
## Impact
System will face bad debt, which can cause insolvency

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I guess that you should provide some limits. One of them is to disallow to borrow small amount(minimum limit should be reached). Another is to disallow repayment that again leaves small debt(still should be bigger than limit or repaid fully). And sam ething for the liquidation, small debt can't be leaved.
Using this approach, your debts will always be attractive for liquidators.
