# Guardian is supposed to be able to pause transfers but isn't

## Summary
Guardian isn't able to pause IBToken transfers

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the docs, guardian should be able to: 
> 2. pause supply, borrow, credit limits, configure markets
> 3. Stop any potential exploits in time

However, currently `setMarketTransferPaused()` is set to `onlyOwner`
```solidity 
function setMarketTransferPaused(address market, bool paused) external onlyOwner {
        DataTypes.MarketConfig memory config = getMarketConfiguration(market);
        require(config.isListed, "not listed");

        config.setTransferPaused(paused);
        ironBank.setMarketConfiguration(market, config);

        emit MarketPausedSet(market, "transfer", paused);
    }
```

In order to be able to `stop any potential exploits in time`, being able to stop market transfers should be considered a must. 
Contrary to the access of control of `setMarketTransfer()`, actions such as `setMarketSupplyCaps()`, `setMarketBorrowCaps()`, `setMarketSupplyPaused()` and  `setMarketBorrowPaused()` are set to `onlyOwnerOrGuardian`. I believe all of these functions to belong to the same class and that Guardian should be able to stop market transfers in order to stop any potential exploits in time. 



## Impact
Guardian might not be able to stop an exploit in time, even though they are supposed to be able to.
