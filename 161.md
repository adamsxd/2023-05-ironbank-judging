# Flashloan caller can double paying the flashloaned amount

## Summary
Flashloan caller can double paying the flashloaned amount

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no control of the resulting balance, and any token that successfully performs safeTransferFrom, but for any reason withholds an update of token internal accounting, can successfully steal the whole pool's balance . This can be initiated by an attacker unrelated to token itself as griefing.

**As many core token contracts are upgradable (USDC, USDT and so forth), such behaviour can be not in place right now, but can be introduced in the future.**

## Impact
Some fungible tokens that qualify for Iron bank may not return the whole amount back, but will report successful safeTransferFrom(), i.e. up to the whole balance of Iron bank pool for such ERC20 token can be stolen.

**This can take place in a situation when a popular token was upgraded and the consequences of the internal logic change weren't fully understood by wide market initially and most depositors remained in the corresponding Iron bank pool, then someone calls a flash loan as a griefing attack that will result in the token freezing the balancer of the pool. Or it was understood, but the griefer was quicker.**

## Code Snippet
In FlashLoan.sol, Flash loan functions do not employ any checks after ERC20 token was received back:

```solidity
File: src/flashLoan/FlashLoan.sol

    function flashLoan(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, address token, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data)
        external
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        require(IronBankInterface(ironBank).isMarketListed(token), "token not listed");

        if (!_isDeferredLiquidityCheck) {
            IronBankInterface(ironBank).deferLiquidityCheck(
                address(this), abi.encode(receiver, token, amount, data, msg.sender)
            );
            _isDeferredLiquidityCheck = false;
        } else {
            _loan(receiver, token, amount, data, msg.sender);
        }

        return true;
    }
```

_loan( ) function is used as shown below,

```solidity
File: src/flashLoan/FlashLoan.sol

    function _loan(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, address token, uint256 amount, bytes memory data, address msgSender)
        internal
    {
        IronBankInterface(ironBank).borrow(address(this), address(receiver), token, amount);

        require(receiver.onFlashLoan(msgSender, token, amount, 0, data) == CALLBACK_SUCCESS, "callback failed"); // no fee

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(address(receiver), address(this), amount);

        uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), ironBank);
        if (allowance < amount) {
            IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
        }

        IronBankInterface(ironBank).repay(address(this), address(this), token, amount);
    }
```

The problem is that the code does not check the token balance before and after the flashloan, the code send the token then forcefully pull the token from the receiver.

If within the flashloan callback, the code refund and transfer the borrowed amount back, the code will still try to forcefully pull the token from the receiver address, then the user end up double paying the flashloaned amount.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a balance control check to ensure that flash loan invariant remains: record contract balance before receiver_.onFlashLoan(.......) callback and record it after IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(........), require that resulting token balance ends up being not less than initial.
