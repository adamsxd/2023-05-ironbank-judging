# Market not delisted properly

## Summary
Struct not deleted properly, leaving the nested mappings in the Market struct untouched
## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever there is a nested mapping in a struct, you have to traverse through the mapping in order to delete the values, otherwise the values from the mapping will persist and the market won't be deleted successfully 

## Impact
When deleting a market, it won't delete users borrows and supplies. When added back again, users will benefit.
