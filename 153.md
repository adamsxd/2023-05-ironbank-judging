# Unbounded loop in `executeInternal` Can Lead To `DoS`

[Link to Bug Origin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L142)
## Summary
The [`executeInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL141C1-L197C6) function in the `TxBuilderExtension.sol` contract, has an `Unbounded loop`, that makes multiple external calls to the `ironBank.sol` contract which can lead to `DOS`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `executeInternal` function iterates over the `actions` array starting from the specified `index`. For each element in the array, it performs a specific `action` based on the name field of the `Action` structure, and for each  action, it makes certain `external calls` to the `ironBank` contract,
As you could see the function, doesn't provide a `limit` to the amount of `iteration` it should go,  With all of this happening in the loop and costing gas it may revert due to exceeding the block size `gas limit`. when the contract will be in a state where the amount of gas it used will cause its transaction to never be added to a block due to the block gas limit, this will cause a `DOS` as it will always exceed the available `gas limit per block`. meaning if called through the [`execute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL100C1-L102C6)  or the [`onDeferredLiquidityCheck`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL105C1-L111C6) function it will `revert`,

## Impact
There are over multiple `actions` that the loop has to go through. Halfway through, the execution fails due to exceeding the block size `gas limit`.

## Tool used

`Manual Review`

## Recommendation.
`Iteration Limit`: Implement a limit on the number of iterations allowed in the loop to prevent potential abuse or excessive `computation`.
or Consider avoiding all the `actions` executed in a `single transaction`, especially when calls are executed as part of a `loop`.
