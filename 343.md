# The function `setcreditlimit` can be `frontruned` leading to more funds being collected.

## Summary
The function `setcreditlimit` can be frontrun to borrow above the amount intended by the `creditlimitManager`

## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract the function `setcreditlimit` is used to set the credit limit of a user. if the user already has a credit limit the function can be used to increase or decrease the user's credit limit. A malicious user can frontrun this call to borrow before his credit limit is reset to a different limit which he can still borrow.
```solidity
 function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 credit) external onlyCreditLimitManager {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        if (credit == 0 && creditLimits[user][market] != 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].deleteElement(market);
        } else if (credit != 0 && creditLimits[user][market] == 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].push(market);
        }

        creditLimits[user][market] = credit;
        emit CreditLimitChanged(user, market, credit);
    }
```

## Impact
Through a sandwich attack, a malicious user can borrow to their credit limit and after the limit has been reset, borrow again, which leads to the user borrowing more funds than intended.
