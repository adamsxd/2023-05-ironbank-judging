# Protocol understates the value of user's collateral, which can lead to issues including premature liquidation

## Summary

The protocol does not correctly calculate the value of a user's underlying collateral, which can lead to multiple issues, with the most prevalent being premature liquidation

## Vulnerability Detail

Although the undervaluing of a user's collateral can lead to many issue with the protocol functionality, the most prevalent is the potential for premature liquidations, which will lead to unfair loss of user funds. Fundamentally the issue is that the value of a user's collateral includes the interest owed to that user for their collateral. However, the protocol does not correctly handle incorporating this interest. Let's see how.

When a user is being liquidated, another user will call `liquidate`. In this call, interest is first accrued to `marketBorrow` and `marketCollateral`. Then, a check is done to see if the borrower is liquidatable:
```solidity
_accrueInterest(marketBorrow, mBorrow);
_accrueInterest(marketCollateral, mCollateral);

// Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");
```

The `_isLiquidatable` function loops over all the markets that the borrower has collateral in, and uses that to calculate the total value of the user's collateral:
```solidity
uint256 liquidationCollateralValue;
...
for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
	...
	if (supplyBalance > 0 && liquidationThreshold > 0) {
		uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(m);
		liquidationCollateralValue += (supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * liquidationThreshold) / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE;
	}
	...
}
```

The `exchangeRate` value effectively converts a given amount of ibTokens that the user has to the underlying tokens. However, this value is only correct for a given market directly following a call to accrue interest for that market. The main issue arises because this function does not accrue interest to all of the markets that a user has collateral in prior to calculating the value of the user's tokens. This means that their total collateral value can be severely undervalued, especially if they have a lot of unaccounted for interest in markets that the liquidator is not liquidating collateral from.

## Impact

The protocol is in many cases undervaluing the collateral of a given user, which can lead to premature liquidation of that user and ultimately unfair loss of funds, even if they have enough collateral to cover their loan

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the `_isLiquidatable` function, accrue interest to all markets which a user has collateral in prior to calculating the `exchangeRate` for those markets.
