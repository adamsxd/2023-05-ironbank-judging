# Liquidator is able to liquidate the entirety of a user's borrow position, even if they are only slightly undercollateralized

## Summary

The liquidation logic for IronBank allows for the liquidation of a user's entire borrow position even if they are only slightly undercollateralized, which can lead to excessive and unfair losses for borrowers

## Vulnerability Detail

The current liquidation logic for IronBank allows a liquidator to take an arbitrary amount of a user's collateral token (up to the entire borrow amount), even if it far exceeds the amount necessary to make that user's LTV less than the liquidation threshold. The `liquidate` function:
```solidity
function liquidate(
	address liquidator,
	address borrower,
	address marketBorrow,
	address marketCollateral,
	uint256 repayAmount
) {
	...
	// Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
	require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");
	
	// Repay the debt.
	repayAmount = _repay(mBorrow, liquidator, borrower, marketBorrow, repayAmount);
	
	// Seize the collateral.
	uint256 ibTokenAmount = _getLiquidationSeizeAmount(marketBorrow, marketCollateral, mCollateral, repayAmount);
	_transferIBToken(marketCollateral, mCollateral, borrower, liquidator, ibTokenAmount);
	IBTokenInterface(mCollateral.config.ibTokenAddress).seize(borrower, liquidator, ibTokenAmount); // Only emits Transfer event.
}
```

The `_isLiquidatable(borrower)` call only checks that a borrower is liquidatable, not the degree to which they are. Here let's assume that the user's debt is 1 wei over their collateral value. The user is then able to input an arbitrary amount of borrow token to repay: `repayAmount`.  Neither the call to `_repay` nor `_getLiquidationSeizeAmount` validate that the `repayAmount` is excessive with respect to liquidating an amount beyond simply getting the user's LTV to be less than the liquidation threshold. Instead, the liquidator  is able to liquidate an amount equal to the user's entire borrow amount, even as in this case, they are just 1 wei undercollateralized. This can lead to excessive loss of user's funds, as they will pay the liquidation penalty for the entirety of their borrow amount, beyond the amount necessary to make them fully collateralized.

## Impact

The liquidation logic allows for a liquidator to take an arbitrary amount of a user's collateral token (up to the entire borrow amount), even if it far exceeds the amount necessary to make that user's LTV less than the liquidation threshold, leading to potentially huge losses for borrowers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be a check at the end of the `liquidation` function that the user's ending LTV is within a reasonable bound of the liquidation threshold, potentially based on the starting LTV. This will result in only reasonable values for `repayAmount`.
