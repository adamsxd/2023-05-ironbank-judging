# Failure to Accrue Interest in TxBuilderExtension.redeemNativeToken Results in Incorrect Redeem Amount for Full Redemption

## Summary
When a user wants to redeem their full native token from `ironBank` using `TxBuilderExtension`, interest isn't first accrued, leading to the user redeeming the wrong amount, This discrepancy arises because [ironBank.getSupplyBalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L173) multiplies users supply with an outdated market exchange rate
## Vulnerability Detail
Bob, a user of the Iron Bank protocol, intends to redeem all of his previously supplied native tokens from the protocol. To initiate this process, Bob calls the [TxBuilderExtension.execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L100) function with the action parameter set to `ACTION_REDEEM_NATIVE_TOKEN`. Internally, this triggers the execution of the [executeInterna](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L141)l function, which subsequently calls [TxBuilderExtension.redeemNativeToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L275). Within the [redeemNativeToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L275) function, a check is performed to determine if Bob has entered the maximum amount. If the maximum amount is specified, the function retrieves Bob's redeemable balance from `ironBank.getSupplyBalance`.
```solidity
  function redeemNativeToken(address user, uint256 redeemAmount) internal nonReentrant {
        if (redeemAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            redeemAmount = ironBank.getSupplyBalance(user, weth); 
        }

             ......
```
However, the amount returned from `ironBank.getSupplyBalance` will not reflect Bob's up-to-date redeemable amount. This is due to the following reason:

The [ironBank.getSupplyBalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L173) function calculates a user's redeemable amount by multiplying their supply with the stored exchange rate. However, without first accruing interest, the [IronBank._getExchangeRat](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L805)e function will not return an accurate and up-to-date exchange rate.

In particular, `_getExchangeRate` relies on the market's `totalBorrow` and `totalReserves`, which are constantly changing values updated every second. By accruing interest first, it ensures that `_getExchangeRate` calculates the exchange rate using the correct and current values.
```solidity
    function _accrueInterest(address market, DataTypes.Market storage m) internal {
        uint40 timestamp = _getNow();
        uint256 timeElapsed = uint256(timestamp - m.lastUpdateTimestamp);

           ..........
```
## Impact
Users will not get the correct redeem amount when they wish to redeem all of their native tokens, this issue poses a risk to both the protocol and the users. If the redeem amount is lower than expected, it can negatively impact the users by depriving them of their rightful funds. On the other hand, if the redeem amount is higher than expected, it can potentially harm the protocol's liquidity and stability

## Recommendation
Will recommending accruing interest first

```solidity
    function redeemNativeToken(address user, uint256 redeemAmount) internal nonReentrant {
     ++ ironBank.accrueInterest(weth); 
        if (redeemAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            redeemAmount = ironBank.getSupplyBalance(user, weth); 
        }
        ironBank.redeem(user, address(this), weth, redeemAmount);
        WethInterface(weth).withdraw(redeemAmount);
        (bool sent,) = user.call{value: redeemAmount}("");
        require(sent, "failed to send native token");
    }
