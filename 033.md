# PToken.absorb() does not have auth, it may cause user loss fund

## Summary

PToken.absorb() does not have auth. If someone transfers to underlying, the attacker can earn the difference by calling absorb continuously at this time

## Vulnerability Detail

As we can see, the absorb() does not check the user 's balance of `IERC20(underlying)`.If someone transfers to underlying, the attacker can earn the difference by calling absorb continuously at this time
```solidity
    function absorb(address user) public {//@audit no check
        uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 amount = balance - totalSupply();
        _mint(user, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

If someone transfers to underlying, the attacker can earn the difference by calling absorb continuously at this time
