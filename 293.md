# interestIncreased in _accrueInterest may lose a lot of interest due to precision loss if decimal of the underlying is 6 or lower

## Summary
interestIncreased in _accrueInterest may lose a lot of interest due to precision loss if decimal of the underlying is 6 or lower

## Vulnerability Detail
interest calculation is mainly done in the function _accrueInterest, where interestPerSecond is multiplied by the delta of time passed since last accrual. And this interestFactor is multiplied by the current `totalBorrow` to compute the interest to charge.

Since the totalBorrow is in the decimal of the underlying asset. Consider a case where the underlying asset has a decimal of 6. And the totalBorrow is 100. And the market has a borrow interest of 5% currently. 
a 5% per annual interest rate =>  borrowRatePerSecond 1547125957
(`1.05 ^ (1/365  / 86400) * 10^18 - 10^18`)

A block has 12second, so the interestIncreased in a block would be 1, however the real interest should be 1.856.
```solidity
uint256 interestFactor = borrowRatePerSecond * timeElapsed;
uint256 interestIncreased = (interestFactor * totalBorrow) / 1e18;

(1547125957 * 12) * (100 * 10^6)  /  1e18 => 1.856
```

There is a 40%+ percent interest revenue loss. 

## Impact
Precision loss leading to loss of interest / reduced actual interest rate, for underlying asset that has 6 decimals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider standardize the decimal in the internal system to 18, and maintain a conversion to/and underlying asset with their decimals.
