# XDZIBEC-computeAddress function does not include fee tier in hash

## Summary
The `computeAddress()` function in the` Uniswap V3` library does not include the `fee` tier in the `hash` of the `pool key`. This can cause the function to return the wrong address for a `pool` key with the same `token0`, `token1`, and factory addresses, but a different `fee` tier.an attacker can cause to users to lose money if they try to `deposit` or `withdraw` funds from a `pool `with the wrong address.
## Vulnerability Detail
 ```solidity
/**
     * @notice Compute the CREATE2 address for a pool without making any external calls
     * @param factory The Uniswap V3 factory contract address
     * @param key The pool key
     */
    function computeAddress(address factory, PoolKey memory key) internal pure returns (address pool) {
        require(key.token0 < key.token1);
        pool = address(
            uint160(
                uint256(
                    keccak256(
                        abi.encodePacked(
                            hex"ff",
                            factory,
                            keccak256(abi.encode(key.token0, key.token1, key.fee)),
                            POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        );
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the `computeAddress()` function, so the problem is in the line  that it uses the `keccak256` function to compute the `hash` of the key struct, the `keccak256` function does not include the `fee` field in the `hash`. This means that the `computeAddress()` function will always return the same address for any `pool` key with the same `token0`, `token1`, and factory addresses, regardless of the `fee` tier
## Impact
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability  by malicious users to create fake pool addresses that look like legitimate pool addresses. This could trick users into depositing funds into fake pools, which the malicious users could then steal and is going to lead to stealing funds from users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- use the `sha3` function instead of the `keccak256` function, the `sha3` function includes all of the fields in the struct in the hash.
