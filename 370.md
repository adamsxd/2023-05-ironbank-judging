# IronBank should consult with Arbitrum Chainlink Sequencer Uptime Feed before using oracles

## Summary

When IronBank is deployed to Arbitrum, Ironbank should consult the Chainlink Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the Chainlink oracle.



## Vulnerability Detail

When communicating with a Chainlink oracle on Arbitrum, Arbitrum [suggests](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) communicating with their L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that their oracles on Arbitrum's L2 is up-to-date. 
 

## Impact

If the Arbitrum L2 Sequencer goes down, there is a risk that oracle data will become stale causing IronBank to do certain actions that may or may not make sense such as loans becoming unnecessary liquidated or excessive borrowing to occur.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Get price from Chainlink.
 * @param base The base asset
 * @param quote The quote asset
 * @return The price
 */
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // audit: There is no check that the Arbitrum L2 sequencer is up-to-date.
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    // DONE - Audit: decimals is assumed to be less than 18, which is not always the case.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ironbank should check the Sequencer uptime feed status to ensure that the L2 has received the latest data.
