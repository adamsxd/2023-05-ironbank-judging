# Oracle has no check for timestamp

## Summary

There is no validation done on timestamp returned from latestRoundData(). The borrower could borrow assets beyond his limit with the stale price.

## Vulnerability Detail

The price oracle does not check round completeness.

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

## Impact

The borrower could borrow assets beyond his limit with the wrong price and leave a bad debt.
