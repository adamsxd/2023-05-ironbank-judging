# Borrowers can DOS liquidation

## Summary
Borrowers can DOS liquidation if the liquidator doesn't use uint256 max amount for repayAmount.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 * @param repayAmount The amount of asset to repay, or type(uint256).max for max
     */
    function liquidate(
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        address marketBorrow,
        address marketCollateral,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(liquidator) {
```
When using liquidate() function, liquidators use repayAmount for how much collateral they want to liquidate.
```solidity
// Repay the debt.
        repayAmount = _repay(mBorrow, liquidator, borrower, marketBorrow, repayAmount);
```
And repayAmount is used in _repay() function.

```solidity
require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
```
In _repay() function, this line causes the issue.
```solidity
if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            amount = borrowBalance;
        }
```

If the liquidator doesn't use type(uint256).max for repayAmount, the borrower can front-run this tx and repay some of his debt and reverts the liquidators tx.

```solidity
require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
```
When the borrower front-run the liquidators tx and repays some of his debts, his borrowBalance will be lower than the liquidators repayAmount so the liquidate() function will revert.

## Impact
Borrowers can escape liquidation.

## Recommendation
```solidity
if (amount > borrowBalance) {
            amount = borrowBalance;
        }
