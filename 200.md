# The `_loan` function of the FlashLoan contract will revert if the requested `amount` is greater than the existing non-zero `allowance` approved for the IronBank contract

## Summary

Due to the use of `safeApprove` in the `_loan` function of the FlashLoan contract, when the requested flash loan `amount` is greater than the existing `allowance` approved for the IronBank contract, the `_loan` function will always revert

## Vulnerability Detail

The use of `safeApprove` as it is used in the `_loan` function of the FlashLoan contract can result in calls to the `_loan` function reverting. It's implemented as follows:
```solidity
uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), ironBank);
if (allowance < amount) {
	IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
}
```
In the first call to `_loan`, `allowance` will be 0, and so the `safeApprove` call will work as intended. However, for tokens in which do not treat `type(uint256).max` as a separate value in the `approve` function (meaning the allowance is still decremented), this allowance will decrease over time. At the point in which `allowance < amount` for the second time, the call to `safeApprove` will always revert because the existing allowance is not 0. This can break external integrations which rely on the flash loan functionality.

## Impact

Due to the use of `safeApprove`, it is possible for the FlashLoan contract to get into a state where it almost always reverts for calls to the `_loan` function, which completely breaks the flash loan functionality

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace the `safeApprove` call with `safeIncreaseAllowance` as follows:
```solidity
- uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), ironBank);
- if (allowance < amount) {
- 	 IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
- }
+ IERC20(token).safeIncreaseAllowance(ironBank, amount);
```
