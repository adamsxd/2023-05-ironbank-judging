# seizeNative() may be fails because no payable keyword while sending Native token .

## Summary
According to solidity [docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/080-breaking-changes.html#new-restrictions) " compiler cannot determine whether or not these addresses are payable or not, so it now requires an explicit conversion to make this requirement visible. The global variables tx.origin and msg.sender have the type address instead of address payable. One can convert them into address payable by using an explicit conversion, i.e., payable(tx.origin) or payable(msg.sender)." . Before sending the ether to EOA(External Owned Account) like payable(address recpient).

## Vulnerability Detail
 [seizeNative()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL128C4-L128C26) function is there for send the native token to recipient address looks like below 
```solidity
    function seizeNative(address recipient) external onlyOwner {
        (bool sent,) = recipient.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(sent, "failed to send native token");
    }
```
In above code there is no payable keyword for recipient address or seizeNative() function. If recipient address is EOA (External owned account) and non-payable address  then seizeNative() function will fail . Even solidity compiler cannot determine whether address are payable or not.


## Impact
If recipient address is not payable then [seizeNative()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL128C4-L128C26) function maybe get fail.

## Reference

## Recommendation
Add payable keyword for [seizeNative()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL128C4-L128C26) function  and recipient address .
 ```solidity 
//@audit add payable keyword 
    function seizeNative(address payable recipient) payable external onlyOwner {
        (bool sent,) = recipient.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(sent, "failed to send native token");
    }
```
