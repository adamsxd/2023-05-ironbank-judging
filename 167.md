# Incomplete validation of ptoken association with the market being hard delisted.

## Summary

When hard delisting a market the function harddelist market only checks if the underlying asset is listed and has a valid ptoken address. However , it doe not check whether the ptoken address retrieved is associated with the market being hard delisted.

## Vulnerability Detail

         if (config.isPToken) {
            address underlying = PTokenInterface(market).getUnderlying();
            DataTypes.MarketConfig memory underlyingConfig = getMarketConfiguration(underlying);
            // It's possible that the underlying is not listed.
            if (underlyingConfig.isListed && underlyingConfig.pTokenAddress != address(0)) {
                underlyingConfig.pTokenAddress = address(0);
                ironBank.setMarketConfiguration(underlying, underlyingConfig);

                emit MarketPTokenSet(underlying, address(0));
            }
        }

        ironBank.delistMarket(market);


Here, it checks if the market is a pToken (_config.isPToken_). If it is, it retrieves the underlying asset address (underlying) using the getUnderlying function of the _PTokenInter_face. Then, it retrieves the market configuration for the underlying asset (_underlyingConfig)._

The code further checks if the underlying asset is listed (_underlyingConfig.isListed_) and if it has a valid pToken address (underlyingConfig.pTokenAddress != address(0)). If both conditions are met, it proceeds with further operations.

However, what the code does not verify is whether the retrieved underlying asset's pToken address (_underlyingConfig.pTokenAddress_) is actually associated with the market being delisted (market). In other words, it assumes that the pToken address retrieved from the underlying asset's configuration is the same pToken that corresponds to the market being hard delisted.

## Impact

An attacker might manipulate the configuration of the underlying asset, associating it with a different, potentially malicious pToken address. As a result, the code would proceed with updating the configuration of the underlying asset based on the incorrect pToken association, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exploitation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 It is important to verify the retrieved pToken address (underlyingConfig.pTokenAddress) corresponds to the market being delisted. This  could involve checking the pToken address against a trusted registry or mapping that maintains the correct associations between pTokens and underlying assets.
