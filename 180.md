# Internal Accounting for fee-on-transfer tokens like USDT/USDC will mess up the internal accounting in the IronBank which could make some users to not be able to redeem their tokens

## Summary
- fee-on-transfer tokens like USDT/USDC will mint more IBTokens than the real total balance that the IronBank contract holds of the underlying token, also, the internal accounting will be updated using an incorrect value that won't reflect the real balance of the underlying token hold by the IronBank contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The `IronBank.supply()` function receives the amount of tokens to be supplied as a parameter and uses that exact value to update the internal accounting balances, mint new IBTokens and request the transfer of funds from the supplier into the IronBank contract. [(here)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L306-L331)
- 
  - The issue occurs when dealing with tokens that charge fees as part of the transfer of tokens, those fees are deducted from the amount of tokens that the receiver will receive.
    - The IronBank doesn't take into account that tokens can charge fees during the transfer and the contract directly uses the value of the `amount` parameter to update the `Market.totalCash`, and to calculate the `ibTokenAmount` which will be used to update the `Market.totalSupply` & the `Market.userSupplies`.
  - As the market grows and more IBTokens are minted in circulation, there won't be enough of the underlying asset to back up all the IBTokens in circulation

- When the IronBank contract interacts with fee-on-transfer tokens it will receive fewer tokens than what was requested to be transferred on the [`safeTransferFrom()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L339) (because of the charged fees by the contract of the ERC20 token).

## Impact
- The internal accounting of the total balance of the underlying token (Market.totalCash) will not accurately reflect the real balance that IronBank contract holds, in the event that enough users redeem their collateral, IronBank could run out of tokens on its balance, and the Market.totalCash will still show that there is some balance in the contract, when in reality the contract has no tokens left, thus, **some users won't be able to redeem their underlying token, leaving them with IBTokens that are not claimable because the contract has not underlying tokens to send back to the users.**

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The recommendation to prevent a discrepancy between the internal accounting (`Market.totalCash`, `Market.userSupplies` & `Market.totalSupply`) and the real amount of underlying tokens that the IronBank has available to redeem the IBTokens, is to calculate the exact amount of tokens received after the safeTransferFrom(), and use that value to compute and update the storage accordingly 
- This means that the safeTransferFrom() will need to be executed first, then calculate the number of tokens that were received and update the storage according to the number of tokens that were indeed received.

```solidity
function supply(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
    external
    nonReentrant
    isAuthorized(from)
{
    ...

    // Get the exact received amount of tokens out of the safeTransferFrom
+   uint256 receivedTokens = IERC20(market).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);

+   uint256 ibTokenAmount = (receivedTokens * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);

    // Update storage.
+   m.totalCash += receivedTokens;
    m.totalSupply += ibTokenAmount;
    unchecked {
        // Overflow not possible: supplyBalance + ibTokenAmount is at most totalSupply + ibTokenAmount, which is checked above.
        m.userSupplies[to] += ibTokenAmount;
    }

    ...
    

+   emit Supply(market, from, to, receivedTokens, ibTokenAmount);
}
```
