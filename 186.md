# Lack of Checks for Zero Address in IronBank.sol

## Summary

In the IronBank.sol contract, there are multiple functions that do not perform checks to verify if the `address` passed is the zero address. This could potentially lead to unexpected behaviors and may result in loss of funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In IronBank.sol, several functions like `supply`, `borrow`, `repay` etc., accept addresses as parameters, but they do not verify if the passed addresses are the zero address. 

For example, the `supply` function in IronBank.sol:

```solidity
function supply(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount) external;
```

Here, the function does not perform a check to see if the `from` or `to` addresses are zero addresses.

A similar situation is observed with other functions like `borrow`, `repay`, etc.

## Impact

This might allow users to send funds or make transactions to the zero address, causing loss of those funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is generally recommended to prevent interactions with the zero address in contract functions. A simple `require` statement can be used to ensure that the addresses passed as parameters are not zero.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

The following steps can be taken to reproduce this issue:

1. Deploy the IronBank.sol contract.
2. Call the `supply` function with `from` or `to` as the zero address.
3. Observe that the function successfully executes without any error.
4. The tokens from the `from` address would be transferred to the zero address, thereby effectively burning the tokens.
