# No check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down in PriceOracle.sol

## Summary

When using Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it is necessary to perform a check for sequencer downtime to prevent the usage of prices that may appear fresh but are actually not.

This could allow malicious actors to exploit the sequencer downtime to their advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a lack of a check if the L2 Arbitrum sequencer is down

```solidity=!
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

## Impact

There is a possibility that malicious actors could exploit this to gain an unfair advantage.

For examples:

- Users can get better borrows if the price is above the actual price
- Users can avoid liquidations if the price is under the actual price
