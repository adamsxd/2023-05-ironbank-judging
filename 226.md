# XDZIBEC-sqrtPriceLimitX96 Parameter Not Checked for Zero in quoteExactOutputSingle() Function

## Summary
The `sqrtPriceLimitX96` parameter in the `quoteExactOutputSingle()` function is not checked for zero. This means that an attacker could specify a zero price limit, which would cause the function to return an incorrect amount. This could lead to the user losing money or receiving less than they expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function quoteExactOutputSingle(QuoteExactOutputSingleParams memory params)
        external
        returns (
            uint256 amountIn,
            uint160 sqrtPriceX96After,
            uint32 initializedTicksCrossed,
            uint256 gasEstimate
        );
}
```
The vulnerability is in the  `quoteExactOutputSingle()` function that the  `calculateAmountIn()` function does not check to make sure that the `sqrtPriceLimitX96` parameter is not zero. This means that an attacker could specify a zero price limit, which would cause the `calculateAmountIn()` function to return an incorrect amount.
## Impact
- an attacker can specify a zero price limit, which would cause the function to return an incorrect amount. This could lead to the user losing money or receiving less than they expected.

## Recommendation
- the `sqrtPriceLimitX96` parameter should be checked to make sure that it is not zero
