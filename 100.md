# A credit account user may not be able to redeem their funds even though they should be able to

## Summary
A credit account user might be unable to redeem their stake. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario: User A has some stake in IronBank. He is then given a large creditLimit, which he uses and takes out a large borrow. The user can no longer withdraw their stake, since when calling `redeem`, `_checkAccountLiquidity(from);` is called. Since the borrowed amount costs significantly more than the user's stake, `_checkAccountLiquidity` will always revert. The only way for the user to withdraw their money is if they repay their loan, which basically makes the user's stake the same as collateral - the user cannot get ahold of it until he repays back his loan. This completely destroys the purpose of Credit Accounts and Credit Limits. 

```solidity
function _checkAccountLiquidity(address user) internal {
        uint8 status = liquidityCheckStatus[user];

        if (status == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_NORMAL) {
            (uint256 collateralValue, uint256 debtValue) = _getAccountLiquidity(user);
            require(collateralValue >= debtValue, "insufficient collateral");
        } else if (status == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DEFERRED) {
            liquidityCheckStatus[user] = LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DIRTY;
        }
    }
```
```solidity
function _getAccountLiquidity(address user) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 collateralValue;
        uint256 debtValue;

        address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
            if (!m.config.isListed) {
                continue;
            }

            uint256 supplyBalance = m.userSupplies[user];
            uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, user);

            uint256 assetPrice = PriceOracleInterface(priceOracle).getPrice(userEnteredMarkets[i]);
            require(assetPrice > 0, "invalid price");
            uint256 collateralFactor = m.config.collateralFactor;
            if (supplyBalance > 0 && collateralFactor > 0) {
                uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(m);
                collateralValue += (supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * collateralFactor) / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE;
            }
            if (borrowBalance > 0) {
                debtValue += (borrowBalance * assetPrice) / 1e18;
            }
        }
        return (collateralValue, debtValue);
    }
```

## Impact
A credit account's stake instantly becomes collateral, completely destroying the purpose of credit accounts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When calculating liquidity, do not take into account the borrowed amount from a user's creditLimit.
