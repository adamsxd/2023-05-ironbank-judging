# Arbitrary Changes in Liquidation Threshold May Lead to Unexpected User Liquidations

## Summary
The function `adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold()` in the contract allows the contract owner to adjust the `liquidationThreshold` arbitrarily without performing a check to see if this change would place existing users under the new `liquidationThreshold`, potentially leading to unexpected liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold()` function in the contract allows the contract owner to adjust the `liquidationThreshold` for a given market. However, this function doesn't include any checks to ensure that this change won't immediately cause existing user positions to become under-collateralized, which may trigger unexpected liquidations for the affected users. A malicious or careless contract owner could misuse this feature to the detriment of users.

## Impact
The impact is significant. Users who have been maintaining their positions in accordance with the previous liquidationThreshold may suddenly find their positions being liquidated due to an unexpected change in the threshold. This could lead to monetary losses for these users and a potential loss of trust in the platform.

```solidity

    function adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold(address market, uint16 liquidationThreshold) external onlyOwner {
        DataTypes.MarketConfig memory config = getMarketConfiguration(market);
        require(config.isListed, "not listed");
        if (liquidationThreshold > 0) {
            require(liquidationThreshold <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD, "invalid liquidation threshold");
            require(
                liquidationThreshold >= config.collateralFactor, "liquidation threshold smaller than collateral factor"
            );
            require(
                uint256(liquidationThreshold) * uint256(config.liquidationBonus) / FACTOR_SCALE
                    <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_X_BONUS,
                "liquidation threshold * liquidation bonus larger than 100%"
            );
        } else {
            require(config.collateralFactor == 0, "collateral factor not zero");
        }

        config.liquidationThreshold = liquidationThreshold;
        ironBank.setMarketConfiguration(market, config);

        emit MarketLiquidationThresholdSet(market, liquidationThreshold);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Maybe ensure that there is no positions on the market if you are modifying the `liquidationThreshold` to a lower value than the current otherwise make sure that the new `liquidationThreshold` is upper than the previous one
