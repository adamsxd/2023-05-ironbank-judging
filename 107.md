# `DOS` on Critical functions of `TxBuilderExtension.sol` due to ReentracyGuard

[Line of Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L214)
[Instance of Bug](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L234)
## Summary
Functions in the `TxBuilderExtension.sol` make use of the non-reentrant modifier but make calls to function in the `IronBank.sol` which also contains a non-reentrant modifier too. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Function with a non-reentrant modifier cannot call other functions with the same modifier as it will revert causing DOS to users or contracts that call such functions.
as stated by OpenZeppeline, functions that are marked as non-reentrant may not call one another, rather one should use the modifier rather than a function with the non-reentrant modifier calling another one also with such modifier. [Link to OpenZeppelines Doc](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#ReentrancyGuard),
**The functions affected by this issue are:**
`Supply, Borrow, Redeem, Repay - SupplyNativeToken, BorrowNativeToken, RedeemNativeToken, RepayNativeToken - SupplyStEt, BorrowStEt, RedeemStEt, RepayStEt - supplyPToken, redeemPToken`.

**POC** 
`Sample Code` 

The `redeem` function in `TxBuilderExtension.sol` contains the nonReentrant modifier, and makes an external call to the one in the `IronBank.sol`.
```solidity
    function redeem(address user, address asset, uint256 amount) internal nonReentrant {
        ironBank.redeem(user, user, asset, amount);
    }
```
As you can see below the `redeem` function in the `IronBank.sol` also contains the nonReentrant 
```solidity
  function redeem(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        isAuthorized(from)
    { }
```

there is no need of using a nonReentrant modifier on a function that makes external to the core function containing the nonReenntrant modifier as it is most likely going to revert. 
## Impact
This will cause these functions to always revert thereby making the `TxBuilderExtension.sol` contract useless.

## Tool used

`Manual Review`, `OpenZeppeline Docs`

## Recommendation
Remove the non Reentrant modifier from the functions in the `TxBuilderExtension.sol` as the core functions call when they are called are already protected from reentrancy but make sure to follow the `CEI` pattern. to avoid any issue of reentrancy.
