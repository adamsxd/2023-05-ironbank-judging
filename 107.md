# Liquidation Might Revert Due to Out of Gas When User Entered too many Markets

## Summary
In IronBank.sol `liquidate()`, users total collateral value across all entered markets is accessed. Since there is no cap on how many markets the protocol would support and the maximum number of markets a user account could enter, the liquidation transaction may run out of gas.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_isLiquidatable()` check, a for loop of all user-entered markets will be run. This function may run out of gas if the `userEnteredMarkets` array is too big. 
```solidity
//IronBank.sol
    function _isLiquidatable(address user) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 liquidationCollateralValue;
        uint256 debtValue;

        address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
  >>>>     for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
```
There is no cap on the total number of markets that the protocol will support. Plus, an underlying token asset can also have a separate PToken market, which increases the total number of markets the protocol will hold. 

In addition, there is no cap on the number of markets a user account could enter. 
```solidity
//IronBank.sol
    function _enterMarket(address market, address user) internal {
        if (enteredMarkets[user][market]) {
            // Skip if user has entered the market.
            return;
        }

        enteredMarkets[user][market] = true;
        allEnteredMarkets[user].push(market);

        emit MarketEntered(market, user);
    }
```
A malicious user could first deposit enough collateral to markets with high collateral factors and then borrow maximally against deposited collateral for external trades, then they can enter as many markets as possible each with a very small supply. When there are enough markets to enter to perform the attack, the user account cannot be liquidated due to out of gas error during the `_isLiquidatable`check.
## Impact
User accounts may not be liquidated. A malicious user may borrow maximally and enter as many markets as possible to prevent liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a maximum number of markets a user account could enter and enforce the check on the cap in `_enterMarket()`.
