# Oracle can return stale data and negatively impact protocol operations

# Oracle can return stale data and negatively impact protocol operations
## Impact
Using stale price data can put protocol funds at risk.  For example accounts could become liquidatable at real price but could remain liquid due to the stale price value returned.

Users could also Borrow at a discounted rate and then redeem immediately as `_checkAccountLiquidity` would pass for the stale discounted price creating MEV opportunities.

## Proof of Concept
[protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72)

In the `getPriceFromChainlink` function, the `latestRoundData` function is invoked without checking whether the returned value is stale. It is crucial to verify that `updatedAt >= roundID`. Currently, this validation is not present in the code.

As an attacker, I could monitor the mempool for instances where the price obtained from this oracle is outdated, and the returned price is lower than the real-world price. Exploiting this scenario, I can borrow tokens at the stale price. Since L2s replay all missing price transaction updates when they update to the actual current price, I can repay my borrow using the tokens, which are now valued at a higher price. This exploit carries no risk to the attacker because I possess knowledge of the entry and exit prices, and the protocol has provided the underpriced tokens, enabling the exploit.

```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
The following change will ensure that we don't use stale prices
```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 timestamp, uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
		
		require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```
