# Liquidations will be frozen if oracle goes down or price goes to zero

# Liquidations will be frozen if oracle goes down or price goes to zero
## Impact
In certain exceptional circumstances, oracles may experience periods of unavailability or token prices may plummet to zero. During such events, the liquidation process becomes frozen, resulting in all calls reverting for debt holders who possess the affected token. Paradoxically, these critical moments are precisely when enabling liquidations becomes crucial to preserving the protocol's solvency.

## Vulnerability Detail
`getPriceFromChainlink` will revert if the price goes to zero or the oracle goes down
[protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72)

```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote); // @audit MED: Need to check timesicne up for L2s
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```

Calling `IronBank.liquidate` has the following call chain, if the oracle goes down or price goes to Zero,  `liquidate` will revert leaving the protocol vulnerable to bad debt.

`IronBank.liquidate` -> `IronBank._getLiquidationSeizeAmount` -> `getPrice` -> `getPriceFromChainlink`

## Recommendation
In order to mitigate against this situation I would recommend implementing a fallback oracle
