# User can be liquidable in one market but avoid being set as 'liquidable'

## Summary
For a user to be liquidated, it is needed to check if he is actually 'liquidable'. The problem is that the function that checks if a user is liquidable does not do it separately for each market so he can be liquidable at one market and compensate it by its debValue/liquidationCollateralValue ratio on other market.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a liquidator calls the function `liquidate` on the `IronBank.sol` contract to liquidate a user from a certain market in which the liquidable user is taking part if performs a `require` to check if the user is actually liquidable:

```solidity
// Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");
```

The problem is related with the implementation of the `_isLiquidatable` function:

```solidity
function _isLiquidatable(address user) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 liquidationCollateralValue;
        uint256 debtValue;

        address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
            if (!m.config.isListed) {
                continue;
            }

            uint256 supplyBalance = m.userSupplies[user];
            uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, user);

            uint256 assetPrice = PriceOracleInterface(priceOracle).getPrice(userEnteredMarkets[i]);
            require(assetPrice > 0, "invalid price");
            uint256 liquidationThreshold = m.config.liquidationThreshold;
            if (supplyBalance > 0 && liquidationThreshold > 0) {
                uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(m);
                liquidationCollateralValue +=
                    (supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * liquidationThreshold) / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE;
            }
            if (borrowBalance > 0) {
                debtValue += (borrowBalance * assetPrice) / 1e18;
            }
        }
        return debtValue > liquidationCollateralValue;
    }
```

As it can be seen, the `_isLiquidatable` function checks if `debtValue > liquidationCollateralValue` to determine if a user is liquidable or not. The problem is that the calculation of `debtValue` and `liquidationCollateralValue` is done along all the markets that the user is taking part on, it is not done for a single market in which the user can be liquidable.

The following can happen for the same user (the following numbers are simplified to demostrate the issue):
- In market0: debtValue = 5e18 and liquidationCollateralValue = 1e18
- In market1: debtValue = 1e18 and liquidationCollateralValue = 20e18
- Total debtValue = 6e18 and total liquidationCollateralValue = 21e18

A liquidator sees that user is liquidable in market0 as his debValue is higher than his `liquidationCollateralValue` and tries to liquidate the user but as the `liquidable` function returns if the user is liquidable accross all the markets it returns true as the overall value for `liquidationCollateralValue` is higher than the overall value of `debValue`, thefore the user can not be liquidated on market0.


## Impact
Knowing that, a user can borrow a very small amount on a market with a collateral that can potentially grow in value having a huge `liquidationCollateralValue/debtValue` that can compensate other negative `liquidationCollateralValue/debtValue` ratio values in order to avoid being liquidated in these markets where the `liquidationCollateralValue/debtValue` is negative. So a user can potentially avoid being liquidated. The described situation may occur without the user's intentionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the `_isLiquidatable` function for a user and a market. The function should return is the user is liquidable on the input market only.
