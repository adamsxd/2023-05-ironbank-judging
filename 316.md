# Chainlink aggregators return the incorrect price if it drops below `minAnswer`

## Summary

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset
goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset
experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will
continue to return the `minAnswer` instead of the actual price of the asset. See
[Chainlink's docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits)
for more info.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink's `latestRoundData` pulls the associated aggregator and requests round
data from it. ChainlinkAggregators have `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` circuit
breakers built into them. This means that if the price of the asset drops below
the `minAnswer`, the protocol will continue to value the token at `minAnswer`
instead of it's actual value. This will allow users to exploit certain parts of
the protocol.

## Impact

This discrepency could cause major issues within the protocol and potentially
lead to loss of funds through undercollateralization, unfair liquidations, etc. This is exactly what happened to 
[Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote); // @audit missing check on timestamp
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check to ensure that the returned price is between the data feeds `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` values.
