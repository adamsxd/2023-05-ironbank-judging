# Missing checks for whether L2 Sequencer is active

## Summary

Missing checks for whether Optimism or Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Vulnerability Detail

If the Optimism/Arbitrum sequencer were to go offline the Chainlink oracle may return an invalid/stale price. It should always be checked before consuming any data from Chainlink.

## Impact

Stale/invalid prices. Example: if USDC were to de-peg while the sequencer is offline, stale price is used and can result in false liquidations

Protocols should use a data feed that tracks the last known status of the sequencer at a given point in time. This helps prevent mass liquidations by providing a grace period to allow users to react to such an event

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L67

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}

```

As seen above, the Chainlink oracle never checks if the Optimism/Arbitrum sequencer is up, allowing to to consume stale/invalid price data

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider reverting if the Sequencer is offline.
