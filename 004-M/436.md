# `PriceOracle.getPriceFromChainlink()` will return the incorrect price for asset if underlying aggregator hits `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer`

## Summary

`PriceOracle.getPriceFromChainlink()` will return the incorrect price for asset if underlying aggregator hits `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer`

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink aggregators include a built-in circuit breaker mechanism that triggers when the price of an asset exceeds a predetermined price band. However, in situations where an asset experiences a significant decrease in value, such as the LUNA crash, the oracle's price will continue to return the `minPrice` instead of reflecting the actual asset price. Consequently, users can continue to borrow against the asset but at an incorrect price. This exact scenario occurred on Venus within the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network during the LUNA implosion event.

To mitigate the risk of returning incorrect prices and prevent the overvaluation of collateral, it is crucial for the Chainlink oracle to revert when the minimum or maximum answer thresholds are breached. Failure to do so could result in significant abuse and exploitation of the system.

This is exacly the same issue with Blueberry audit contest, which decided as a valid medium https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-blueberry-judging/issues/18

## Impact

During an asset crash, such as the case with LUNA, there exists a potential for the protocol to be manipulated, allowing loans to be repaid at a deflated price.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72

```js
File: PriceOracle.sol
66:     function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
67:         (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
68:         require(price > 0, "invalid price");
69:
70:         // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
71:         return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
72:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

ChainlinkAdapterOracle should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:

```diff
File: PriceOracle.sol
66:     function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
67:         (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
68:         require(price > 0, "invalid price");
69:
+           if (price >= maxPrice || price <= minPrice) revert();
70:         // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
71:         return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
72:     }
```
