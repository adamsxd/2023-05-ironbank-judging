# Oracle price can be stale when L2 sequencer is down

## Summary

Oracle price can be stale when L2 sequencer is down

## Vulnerability Detail

From [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds):    
Optimistic rollup protocols have a sequencer that executes and rolls up the L2 transactions by batching multiple transactions into a single transaction.     
If a sequencer becomes unavailable, it is impossible to access read/write APIs that consumers are using and applications on the L2 network will be down for most users.     
This means that if the project does not check if the sequencer is down, it can return stale results.     

Note that It is a different issue from checking oracle price freshness.        
Because in the case of sharp price fluctuations, the price may be updated several times, although the final price is in freshness, but it may not be the latest price.     
There's a similar [issue](https://solodit.xyz/issues/6689) here.    

## Impact

Medium. Oracle price is stale. Impact borrow, liquidation.

        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }

        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
