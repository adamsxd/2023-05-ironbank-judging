# User can frontrun liquidation & repay dust amounts, which will revert the liquidation, even if the loan is still under-collateralized.

## Summary
When a user goes to liquidate a position, the `_repay` function is called. Inside of the `_repay` function there is the following requirement: 

```solidity
require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
```

If a liquidator wanted to liquidate a position and passed in the exact maximum of `borrowBalance`, the borrower would be able to frontrun the liquidation, repay a very tiny amount, and therefore slightly decrement the `borrowBalance`. This require statement would then cause a revert of the liquidation because the amount passed in (previous borrow balance), is slightly higher than the new `borrowBalance`.

## Vulnerability Detail
POC:
1. Alice has borrowed 100 USDC and currently is under collateralized.
2. Bob goes to liquidate the position, with the repayAmount of 100 USDC.
3. Alice sees this in the mempool, and frontruns the transaction repaying 0.01 USDC. 
4. The new `borrowBalance` is 99.99 USDC
5. Since Bob supplied 100 USDC, the transaction will now revert since `repayAmount > borrowAmount`

## Impact
Borrowers can frontrun liquidations and cause them to revert

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of having the `require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");`, consider a similar approach used when `type(uint256).max` is passed in as the parameter:
```solidity
if(amount > borrowBalance) {
    amountOver = amount - borrowBalance;
    amount = borrowBalance;
}
```
Then continue with the state updates in `_repay`, and finally send back the amountOver to the liquidator, (or borrower if they are repaying their loan, since this function is also used in `repay`).
