# Anybody is able to take left native from TxBuilderExtension contract

## Summary

Contract TxBuilderExtension restricts taking left native from TxBuilderExtension contract by limiting access to seizeNative with onlyOwner modifier, but it is possible to take funds by anybody

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Attacker is able to take any native left in the contract.
