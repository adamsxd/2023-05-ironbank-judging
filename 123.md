# IronBank._getExchangeRate calculations are wrong.

## Summary
```_getExchangeRate``` uses wrong formula for calculating the exchangeRate.

## Vulnerability Detail
Each market has a ```totalReserves``` variable that hold the amount of excess ibTokens which will be used as an additional liquidity for the protocol. 
```absorbToReserves``` function is used to increase reserves by absorbing the slurpus cash. 
```solidity
uint256 ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);
            // Update internal cash, and total reserves.
            m.totalCash += amount;
            m.totalReserves += ibTokenAmount;
```
It updates internal cash and ```m.totalReserves``` but does not increment ```m.totalSupply``` as excess ibTokens should not be added to totalSupply.
The problem arises when using ```redeem``` function. This function calculates the amount to redeem in exchange for ibTokens. It calculates the exchangeRate using ```_getExchangeRate``` function. 
```solidity
return ((m.totalCash + m.totalBorrow) * 1e18) / totalSupplyPlusReserves;
```
The exchange rate here is based on totalCash + totalBorrow / totalSupplyPlusReserves, meaning that this excess of ibTokens is used in calculations while it should not be because it is held separately to provide additional liquidity
The proper way would be to store not only the excess of ibTokens but also the excess of underlying asset, and calculate the exchangeRate usign formula: ```(totalUnderlying - excessUnderlying) / totalSupply```. This approach accurately reflects the real liquidity available in the lending protocol, and does not allow users to access protocol's reserves
## Impact
Because of the wrong calculations when users redeem they can actually redeem a part of the totalReserves because they are used in calculation while they shouldn't be, which also means that protocol is not functioning as it supposed to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change calculations so they don't include the excess of underlying token and excess of ibTokens (which should be used as additional liquidity)
