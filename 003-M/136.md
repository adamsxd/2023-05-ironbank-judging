# Must Approve `Zero` First

[Line of Issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/flashLoan/FlashLoan.sol#L108)
## Summary
In the `flashloan` contract, if a certain condition is true, it approves the `ironBank` contract to an unlimited amount of `tokens`, without considering that the input `token` could revert if it isn't approved to `zero` first.
## Vulnerability Detail
Take a look at the _loan function in the flashloan contract. [Link here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/flashLoan/FlashLoan.sol#LL106C1-L109C10)
```solidity
        if (allowance < amount) {
            IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironbank, type(uint256).max);
        }
```     
Here it just approves the `IronBank` to the desired amount, without considering tokens that revert with approving to `zero` first, and also `safeApprove` function is depreciated in real time, `safeIncreaseAllowance` or `safeDecreaseAllowance` should be used, due to race conditions and more.
## Impact
Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing `non-zero` allowance value. They must first be approved by `zero` and then the actual allowance must be approved, meaning if called with such token the  `_loan` function will always `revert`.

## Tool used

`Manual Review`, `A Little Research`

## Recommendation
While approving to zero is the most used and standard way, it has been depreciated so I would advise the developers to use the `safeIncreaseAllowance` or `safeDecreaseAllowance` function as it mitigates this issue.
A better way would be:
```solidity
        if (allowance < amount) {
            IERC20(token). safeIncreaseAllowance(ironbank, type(uint256).max);
        }
```   

But the more standard way would be:
```solidity
        if (allowance < amount) {
            IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironbank, 0);
            IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironbank, type(uint256).max);
        }
```
