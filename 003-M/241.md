# Allowance not approved to zero first

## Summary
Failure to set allowance to 0 first before updating allowance again can cause _loan() to revert. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens like USDT do not allow you to approve allowance from a non zero value to a non zero value. You need to approve allowance to zero first before you can approve to a non zero value again. safeApprove() does not help you to automatically approve to zero first either.

## Impact
On a sufficient long timeframe, _loan() can revert if it tries to approve allowance because it doesnâ€™t reset allowance to 0 first. This is even more likely on a flashloan contract since there are no fees for taking a flashloan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`Approve()` allowance to 0 then `safeApprove()` to type(uint256).max again to handle non standard ERC20s like USDT, KNC. Alternatively, just approve however much is needed. This is more gas intensive but can handle all edge cases with a single safeApprove.
