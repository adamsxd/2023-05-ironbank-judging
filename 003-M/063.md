# `safeApprove` is deprecated and need to approve by zero first

## Summary
The protocol currently uses these tokens:

>  USDC, USDT, wstETH, WBTC, WETH, DAI and other vanilla ERC20s

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example, Tether (USDT)'s `safeApprove()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens will revert when updating the allowance. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.
Not only that, but `safeApprove` is deprecated, and `OpenZeppelin’s` recommended not use `safeApprove`. 
`safeApprove` also will revert if there is any leftover allowance. This causes broken logic in many spots.

The problem is in `FlashLoan.sol`:
```solidity
108: IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
```

## Impact

The protocol will impossible to use some tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance.

Change this:
```solidity
IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
```

To this:
```solidity
IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, 0);
IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
```
