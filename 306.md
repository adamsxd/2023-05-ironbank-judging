# `IronBank#_getAccountLiquidity()` potentially reverts on multiplication overflow

## Summary

A possible overflow on multi-factor multiplication can put the system in an irrecoverable state.

## Vulnerability Detail

L1051 of `IronBank#_getAccountLiquidity()` contains a four-factor product:

```solidity
collateralValue += (supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * collateralFactor) / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE;
```

Each of the operands is a `uint256`, so the maximum value at any stage in the execution is `2**256 - 1`. With four operands, this presents a challenge, as there is quite a bit of potential for overflow. Let's numerically analyze the potential.

In order to avoid overflow, the result of A * B * C * D must fit within 256 bits. For simplicity, let us express all variables in terms of the maximum number of bits they might occupy, so that we can trivially asses the result of their multiplication as an addition of bits. For example, a 4-bit number times an 8-bit number results in a 12-bit number, per `(2**4) * (2**8) == 2**(4 + 8) == 2**12`.

Each operand is scaled as follows:

- `supplyBalance` has 18 decimals
- `exchangeRate` has 18 decimals
- `assetPrice` has 18 decimals
- `collateralFactor` is at most 10,000

So, we need:

- 14 bits to store the `collateralFactor` because `2**14 - 1 == 16,383` is the closest power of 2 to 10,000.
- 60 bits to store the decimal precision of each of the remaining variables because `2**60 == 1.15e18` is the closest to 1e18.

That makes a total of `3*60 + 14 == 194` bits reserved, where `256 - 194 == 62` bits remain for the rest of the data. That remaining data is the product of the pre-decimal portions of three variables: `supplyBalance`, `exchangeRate`, and `assetPrice`.

Let's make an upper-bound assumption about one of the variables to help narrow down the numerical analysis. The `supplyBalance` is upper-bounded by the total supply of `IBToken`. This would be the case if a single user held the full supply, which could represent a whale or could even represent a contract sitting at a layer of abstraction above the `IronBank`. For a total supply that feels large while still being achievable, let's choose one trillion (1e12) tokens.

To compute the number of bits remaining after accounting for this upper bound of supply, we observe that `2**40 == 1.1e12`, and we subtract 40 bits from the remaining total of 62 for `62 - 40 == 22` bits left.

The variables we have left at this point are `exchangeRate` and `assetPrice`, both of which are technically unbounded. We might expect each to be close to 1 in many circumstances, but there are other valid circumstances where they are not. All that is required in order to create an overflow condition is for the two variables to occupy at least 22 bits.

Let's examine a few sample cases.

1. The two variables evenly split those 22 bits. So, each is at least `2**(22/2) == 2**11 == 2048`.
2. The `exchangeRate` is 1, and the `assetPrice` is at least `2**22 == $4,200,000`.
3. The `exchangeRate` has grown over time to 7 (3 bits), and the `assetPrice` is at least `2**(22-3) == 2**19 == $525,000`.

In any case, this analysis is ultimately subjective, but it seems to this author that there is not enough comfortable overhead present in 256 bits to account for all likely products of these four factors.

## Impact

In the event that an overflow were to occur within `IronBank#_getAccountLiquidity()`, this reversion would propagate to `IronBank#borrow()`, `IronBank#redeem()`, `IBToken#transfer()`, and `IBToken#transferFrom()`! This would create a state in which it is at least temporarily impossible for users to borrow, redeem, or transfer tokens, thereby "bricking" the system.

## Recommendation

Perform the complex arithmetic in multiple phases, rescaling after each multiplication. This creates a small loss of precision but is likely worthwhile when weighed against the risk of overflow. For example, consider this sequence:

```solidity
uint256 collateralValue;
collateralValue = (supplyBalance * exchangeRate) / 1e18;
collateralValue = (collateralValue * assetPrice) / 1e18;
collateralValue = (collateralValue * collateralFactor) / FACTOR_SCALE;
```
