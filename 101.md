# No checks for Arbitrum and Optimism Sequencer being active

## Summary

No checks for Arbitrum and Optimism Sequencer being active

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol states that it will be deployed on Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum and Optimism.

Chainlink recommends that when using their price Oracles, check whether the related sequencer is active. See: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds. These checks are missing in the IronBank protocol.

In case the respective sequencer is not active, the used oracles may have stale prices. This is caused by Layer 2-submitted transactions (e.g. by the aggregating oracles) not being processed.

Here the price is fetched from the Chainlink oracle and no checks for the state of the sequencer can be found: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L67

## Impact

Stale oracle prices would falsefy the calculation of account liquidity which e.g. can lead to the following issues:
1. Wrong liquidtations (when account liquidity is assumed lower than it actually is based on correct asset market prices)
2. Allowing borrowing to much assets (when account liquidity is assumed higher than it actually is based on correct asset market prices)

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Follow the suggestions of Chainlink and determine whether the sequencer is available or not. Don't allow logic that depends on it succeed in the IronBank protocol when sequencer is offline to not get exposure to potentially stale prices and the associated risks.
