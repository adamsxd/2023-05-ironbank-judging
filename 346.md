# The use of the platform can be disrupted if access to Chainlink oracle data feed is blocked

## Summary
Based on the current implementation, for getting price, the protocol should use Chainlink oracle data feed. but As https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles/ mentions, it is possible that Chainlink’s "multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will".
## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the current implementation, for getting price, the protocol should use Chainlink oracle data feed. but As https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles/ mentions, it is possible that Chainlink’s "multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will". 
When this occurs,executing `registry.latestRoundData` will also revert.
## Impact
When this occurs,getPrice functions also revert, which causes denial of service.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The logic for getting the price from the Chainlink oracle data feed should be placed in the `try` block while some fallback logic when the access to the Chainlink oracle data feed is denied should be placed in the `catch` block.
