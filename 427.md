# May not be able to remove the market

## Summary
Functions with gas consumption exceeding the block's gas limit will not be able to complete.
The `deleteElement` function in the Arrays library loops through the number of elements in the largest case, but this may exceed the gas limit, in which case the function reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
IronBank's `delistMarket` uses `deleteElement`. If this process exceeds the gas limit, the market cannot be deleted.
## Impact
The important administrative function of deleting a market is no longer available.
