# Malicious `credit` `account` can ` drain` the `contract`  of it's funds

## Summary
`Credit` `account` can `borrow`  above `creditlimit` using the `borrow` function, thereby withdrawing more funds than required or even `draining` the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `borrow`, the check for if caller is `creditaccount` and if `borrow` `amount` is greater than `creditlimit` comes after the `safetransfer` of funds. A malicious `creditaccount` can potentially drain the contract of it's funds.
```solidity
  function borrow(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        isAuthorized(from)
    {
//More code...
// Update storage.
        unchecked {
            m.totalCash -= amount;
        }
        m.totalBorrow = newTotalBorrow;
        m.userBorrows[from].borrowBalance = newUserBorrowBalance;
        m.userBorrows[from].borrowIndex = m.borrowIndex;

        // Enter the market.
        if (amount > 0) {
            _enterMarket(market, from);
        }

        IERC20(market).safeTransfer(to, amount);

        if (isCreditAccount(from)) {
            require(from == to, "credit account can only borrow to itself");
            require(creditLimits[from][market] >= newUserBorrowBalance, "insufficient credit limit");
        } else {
            _checkAccountLiquidity(from);
        }

        emit Borrow(market, from, to, amount, newUserBorrowBalance, newTotalBorrow);
    }
```

## Impact
`Contract` can be drained by malicious `creditaccount`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `check` for if ` from`  is `creditaccount` should be written before ` safetransfer`  of funds to caller or use a ` modifier` to regulate the `creditaccount`
