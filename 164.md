# Users Whose Collateral Market Has Been Paused Will Evade Liquidation

## Summary
markets whose `ibToken `transfer has been paused, will allow borrowers to accrue bad debts without a way for liquidators to liquidate their position
## Vulnerability Detail
Bob a user of iron bank protocol with a good collateral ratio notices the emission of the event [MarketPausedSet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/MarketConfigurator.sol#L337) indicating that a certain market `ib token` transfer has been paused, bob is aware that if the transfer has been paused the market collateral wouldn't be seizable, due to this check in [ironBank.Liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L480) function 
```solidity
 require(isMarketSeizable(mCollateral), "collateral market cannot be seized");
```
Exploiting this, Bob adds sufficient collateral as supply into the market whose transfer has been paused, this is possible since there's no check in [ironBank.supply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L306) to prevent this, next, bob makes a full redemption from the other markets, this is possible, as long as bob has added a sufficient collateral to the transfer paused market.

With all done, if Bob's position ever get undercollaterized due to market conditions, it will not be possible for liquidators to liquidate bob's position, except the owner reset the market ibtoken setTransferPaused to false

## Impact
Since the protocol relies on liquidators to liquidate undercollateralized positions to recover the borrowed assets and protect the interests of other users and Iron Bank protocol. If Bob's position becomes undercollateralized and the protocol is unable to liquidate his assets to cover the debt, it could result in a loss for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Will recommend adding an additional check in the supply function to ensure that users can only add collateral to markets whose collateral can be seized. Additionally, before pausing the `ibToken` transfer for a specific market, will recommend pausing the `supply `and `borrow `activities in that market. This will allow users to redeem their collateral from the market before it gets paused. Ensuring that users do not have supplies in the to-be-paused market will effectively protect the protocol from the described attack

```solidity
        require(isMarketSeizable(mCollateral), "collateral market cannot be seized");
```
