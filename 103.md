# debt & collateral value is mismatched for tokens with different decimals

## Summary
The collateral & debt value is not normalized to a common decimal value. It uses the underlying ERC20 tokens decimals. That causes the account health calculation to be broken.

## Vulnerability Detail
An account's health is calculated using *all* the ERC20 tokens. Meaning, if you deposit collateral with 18 decimals and borrow a token with 6 decimals, you'll be able to borrow more funds than you're supposed to.

Here's the `_getAccountLiquidity()` function used to check the account's health:
```sol
    function _getAccountLiquidity(address user) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 collateralValue;
        uint256 debtValue;

        address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
            if (!m.config.isListed) {
                continue;
            }

            uint256 supplyBalance = m.userSupplies[user];
            uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, user);

            uint256 assetPrice = PriceOracleInterface(priceOracle).getPrice(userEnteredMarkets[i]);
            require(assetPrice > 0, "invalid price");
            uint256 collateralFactor = m.config.collateralFactor;
            if (supplyBalance > 0 && collateralFactor > 0) {
                uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(m);
                collateralValue += (supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * collateralFactor) / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE;
            }
            if (borrowBalance > 0) {
                debtValue += (borrowBalance * assetPrice) / 1e18;
            }
        }
        return (collateralValue, debtValue);
    }
```

It loops over all the enabled markets for the user and calculates the `collateralValue` and `debtValue` for each of them.

`collteralValue = supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * collateralFactor / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE`, where:
- `supplyBalance` has 18 decimals as it describes the amount of IBTokens the user holds
- `exchangeRate` has the same decimals as the underlying asset, see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#LL810C1-L810C1) (`totalCash` & `totalBorrow` use the asset's decimals while `totalSupply` uses the IBToken's which is 18)
- `assetPrice` also has 18 decimals since the Oracle contract normalizes the price to that for each asset, see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L57)
- `collateralFactor` and `FACTOR_SCALE` both use 5 decimals.

That means that `collateralValue` has the same decimals as the asset: $18 * x * 18 * 5 / 36 / 5 = x$

`debtValue = borrowBalance * assetPrice / 1e18`, where:
- `borrowBalance` has the same decimals as the asset you're borrowing, see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L367)
- `assetPrice` has 18 decimals as described above

That means `debtValue` has the same decimals as the asset: $x * 18 / 18 = x$.

## Impact

This opens up the following attack vector:
- Alice supplies an asset with 18 decimals with a price of $1
- Alice borrows a different asset with 6 decimals with a price of $1.

Because of the difference in decimals, her position is deemed healthy. Her `collateralValue` is 1e18 while her `debtValue` is 1e6.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`collateralValue` and `debtValue` should be normalized to a common decimal value for all of the different markets.
