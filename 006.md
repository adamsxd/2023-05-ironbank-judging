# Oracle is not checking for sequencer uptime

## Summary
Oracle is not checking for sequencer uptime
## Vulnerability Detail
The ArbitrumSequencer can allow tx to be queued while the L2 is offline, these will pass the freshness check but use outdated prices.
## Impact
Because of how Arbitrum works, if the L2 goes offline, tx can still be sent via the [Delayed inbox](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f) on L1.

This could allow the creation of orders which use prices from when the Sequencer was down, which would still pass the freshness check, but may be incorrect or outdated
