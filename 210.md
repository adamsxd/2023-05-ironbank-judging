# Oracles would not work on L2s

## Summary

Oracles would not work on L2s.

## Vulnerability Detail

Iron Bank uses Chainlink protocol as an oracle service. The address of its feed registry is hardcoded during deployment in `PriceOracle.sol`:
```solidity
File: PriceOracle.sol
30:     constructor(address registry_, address steth_, address wsteth_) {
31:         registry = FeedRegistryInterface(registry_); 
32:         steth = steth_;
33:         wsteth = wsteth_;
34:     }
35: 
```

However, while Feed Registry exists on mainnet, it's not present on expected L2 chains (Arbitrum and Optimism):
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/feed-registry#contract-addresses

This would leave L2s instances of Iron Bank without access to current prices, breaking all core functionality.

## Impact

Oracles would not work on L2s, protocol functionality would be broken since no prices could be received.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating oracle functionality in a way that it uses direct Chainlin price feeds instead of registry on L2s.
