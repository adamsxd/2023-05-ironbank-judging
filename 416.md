# Even if market information is deleted, the user's borrowing and supply data will remain.

## Summary
In solidity, deleting a `struct` does not delete the `mapping` information if it encompasses a` mapping`.
This leaves the user's borrowing and lending amounts even if the market information is deleted
## Vulnerability Detail
In ironbank's `delistMarket` function, `delete markets[market]` deletes market information.
However, the internal `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` are not deleted.
## Impact
Critical information cannot be deleted, which may cause unexpected problems.
