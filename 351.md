# User can lose funds on running execute() function

## Summary
Functions that don't require native tokens executes smoothly without any revert when Native tokens are provided. User funds can be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The execute() function expects `actions` as the function argument. execute function is payable because of certain actions which deal with Native tokens such as `ACTION_SUPPLY_NATIVE_TOKEN`, `ACTION_BORROW_NATIVE_TOKEN`.

However, there can be several scenarios where users can lose funds.

If a user calls the `execute()` function with actions such as ACTION_SUPPLY, ACTION_BORROW, ACTION_REDEEM etc and provide a msg.value along with it, the msg.value amount will be completely lost. Since none of the provided action in the execute() function required msg.value but since the function itself was payable the user loses all the funds transferred.

The issue here is not that the function is payable, the issue here is that functions that do not require msg.value also run the function smoothly without any revert.


## Impact

user can lose funds

```solidity
    function execute(Action[] calldata actions) external payable {
        executeInternal(msg.sender, actions, 0);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

the functions related to the Actions which do not require the native token, such as - `supply()` should implement a require check such as:

```solidity
require(msg.value==0, "Native Tokens Not required")
```
