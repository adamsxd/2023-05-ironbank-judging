# XDZIBEC-SelfPermitIfNecessary() Function Does Not Check for Past Deadlines

## Summary
The` selfPermitIfNecessary()` function in the` SelfPermit` interface does not check to make sure that the deadline parameter is not in the past. This means that an attacker could specify a deadline that is in the past, which would cause the function to revert and no amount will be spent. This could lead to the user losing money or receiving less than they expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function selfPermitIfNecessary(
        address token,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external payable;

    /// @notice Permits this contract to spend the sender's tokens for permit signatures that have the `allowed` parameter
    /// @dev The `owner` is always msg.sender and the `spender` is always address(this)
    /// @param token The address of the token spent
    /// @param nonce The current nonce of the owner
    /// @param expiry The timestamp at which the permit is no longer valid
    /// @param v Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s`
    /// @param r Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s`
    /// @param s Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v`
```
- There is a vulnerability  in the `SelfPermit` interface. specially in  the `selfPermitIfNecessary(`) function. The function does not check to make sure that the deadline parameter is not in the past that mean an attacker could specify a deadline that is in the past, which would cause the function to revert and no amount will be spent.
## Impact
- An attacker could specify a deadline that is in the past, which would cause the function to revert and no amount will be spent. This could lead to the user losing money or receiving less than they expected

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The deadline parameter should be checked to make sure that it is in the future
