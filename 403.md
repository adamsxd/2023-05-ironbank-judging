# If the user enters the market too much, the borrow function will be disabled.

## Summary
Functions with gas consumption exceeding the block's gas limit will not be able to complete; since the `borrow` function contains an unlimited number of loops inside, once the gas limit is reached, the `borrow` function cannot be used any more.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_getAccountLiquidity` function, loop through `allEnteredMarkets[user].length`. If this exceeds the gas limit of the block, the borrow function that internally calls `_getAccountLiquidity` cannot be invoked.
## Impact
Users will not be able to use important features in the protocol.
