# getPrice() of PriceOracle.sol may return stale price

## Summary
In order to obtain the most up-to-date price information, it is recommended to include the updatedAt return value from the latestRoundData() function when fetching the price from the Chainlink Oracle in the getPriceFromChainlink() function of PriceOracle.sol.
Which can be used to check the weather price value received is recent or not.

## Vulnerability Detail
getPriceFromChainlink() function of PriceOracle.sol is not catching the updatedAt return value from latestRoundData() function, resulting in lack of check weather received data is latest enough to use :
consider following excerpt from [chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/#check-the-timestamp-of-the-latest-answer) : 

> " Your application should track the latestTimestamp variable or use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay."

## Impact
Ironbank.sol may end up evaluating users health incorrectly because of these erroneous price feed.
