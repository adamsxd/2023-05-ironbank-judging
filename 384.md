# Missing stale price check from Chainlink oracle

## Summary
`PriceOraclegetPriceFromChainlink` uses `latestRoundData` and checks if price > 0 for uptime output but does not check if the price is stale.
## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink's `latestRoundData` could return a stale price, e.g. due to round completeness not met. If this occurs, it has impact on collateral calculation, mostly on IronBank.sol where collateral is calculated to check account liquidity when borrowing or for a liquidation. 
## Impact
Collateral value could return a wrong value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Next to `answer` which is used as `price` here, check the other returned output from Chainlink:
`uint80 roundId,
 int256 answer,
 uint256 startedAt,
 uint256 updatedAt,
 uint80 answeredInRound`
