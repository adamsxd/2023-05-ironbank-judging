# Liquidating doesn't check `m.config.isTransferPaused()`

## Summary
Markets have the option to pause transfers in certain scenarios. However, liquidating doesn't check if market is paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
When liquidating, there lacks a check of whether the market transfer is paused. This would allow for liquidations/ transfers in cases where users shouldn't really be able to. 
Contrary, when normally transferring IBTokens, via `transferIBToken()` there is a check if transfer is paused. When transferring same IBTokens via `liquidate()` there isn't a check. 
```solidity
function liquidate(
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        address marketBorrow,
        address marketCollateral,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(liquidator) {
        DataTypes.Market storage mBorrow = markets[marketBorrow];
        DataTypes.Market storage mCollateral = markets[marketCollateral];
        require(mBorrow.config.isListed, "borrow market not listed");
        require(mCollateral.config.isListed, "collateral market not listed");
        require(isMarketSeizable(mCollateral), "collateral market cannot be seized");
        require(!isCreditAccount(borrower), "cannot liquidate credit account");
        require(liquidator != borrower, "cannot self liquidate");

        _accrueInterest(marketBorrow, mBorrow);
        _accrueInterest(marketCollateral, mCollateral);

        // Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
        require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");

        // Repay the debt.
        repayAmount = _repay(mBorrow, liquidator, borrower, marketBorrow, repayAmount);

        // Seize the collateral.
        uint256 ibTokenAmount = _getLiquidationSeizeAmount(marketBorrow, marketCollateral, mCollateral, repayAmount);
        _transferIBToken(marketCollateral, mCollateral, borrower, liquidator, ibTokenAmount);
        IBTokenInterface(mCollateral.config.ibTokenAddress).seize(borrower, liquidator, ibTokenAmount); // Only emits Transfer event.

        emit Liquidate(liquidator, borrower, marketBorrow, marketCollateral, repayAmount, ibTokenAmount);
    }
```

## Impact
Liquidating people in cases where liquidations shouldn't be possible. Transferring tokens when market is supposed to be paused.

## Recommendation
When liquidating, check if transfer is paused for said market.
