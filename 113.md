# Lack of Access control can lead to a Front-Run Vulnerability in supplyPToken Function Calls

## Summary

The supplyPToken function calls within the TXBuilderExtension.sol and UniswapExtension.sol scripts can be front-run, allowing an attacker to prematurely call the `absorb()` function in the PToken.sol contract. This can result in undesired pToken minting to the attacker's address or potential denial of service by inhibiting users from depositing funds into the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `supplyPToken` function, after the underlying tokens are transferred from the sender to the pToken contract, the `absorb()` function in PToken.sol is called. This function mints pTokens equal to the surplus underlying assets to the address of the caller.

The problem is that there is no access control in `absorb() `
An attacker observing the mempool can front-run this transaction. This means that they can call the `absorb()` function with a higher gas price, which encourages miners to include their transaction in a block before the legitimate transaction. As a result, the attacker can have pTokens minted to their address instead of the intended user's address.

Additionally, an attacker can repeatedly front-run the supplyPToken transaction calls to prevent other users from successfully depositing their underlying tokens, causing a denial of service.

## Impact
The attacker gains an unjust advantage by accumulating pTokens that should have been minted for legitimate users. At the same time, the ability of genuine users to interact with the contract and make deposits is inhibited, thus affecting the usability and integrity of the contract.

```solidity
    function supplyPToken(address pToken, uint256 amount) internal nonReentrant {
        address underlying = PTokenInterface(pToken).getUnderlying();
        IERC20(underlying).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, pToken, amount);
        PTokenInterface(pToken).absorb(address(this));
        IERC20(pToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(ironBank), amount);
        ironBank.supply(address(this), msg.sender, pToken, amount);
    }
```

        ironBank.supply(address(this), user, pToken, amount);
    }

```solidity
    function absorb(address user) public {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 amount = balance - totalSupply();
        _mint(user, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. A solution to this front-running issue can be achieved by implementing a commit-reveal scheme. In such a scheme, a user submits a hashed version of their transaction (the "commit") and later reveals the transaction details (the "reveal") for execution.

2. You could also ensure that the transaction comes from an authorized extensions

3. You might also consider using a design pattern that requires the caller of supplyPToken to also be the sender of the underlying assets. This way, the absorb() function could be modified to only mint tokens to the sender of the underlying tokens, preventing a front-runner from benefiting.
