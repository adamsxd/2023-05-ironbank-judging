# Ability to Prevent Liquidation by Repaying Minimal Amount

## Summary
A mechanism in the protocol allows borrowers to avoid liquidation by repaying a minuscule amount of the borrowed asset (most in a full liquidation scenario), potentially disrupting the integrity of the liquidation process.
Liquidated user has the ability to do that each liquidation request

## Vulnerability Detail

The function _repay() in the protocol allows a borrower to repay their loan, with the potential to circumvent a pending full liquidation. 
This is possible because the function checks if the repaid amount is less than or equal to the current borrow balance : `require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");`
Therefore, if a borrower is about to be fully liquidated, they can repay 1 wei of the borrowed asset to avoid the liquidation process by front-running the current transaction. The _repay() function does not have a mechanism in place to prevent this behavior, allowing borrowers to exploit this loophole repeatedly to avoid liquidation.

## Impact
This functionality has several significant implications for the system's stability and fairness. It allows borrowers who should be fully liquidated due to their risky positions to remain in the system, effectively reducing the system's risk management effectiveness. This may lead to losses for liquidators and can decrease the system's overall health. The protocol's integrity could be questioned if certain users continually evade liquidation, which could lead to decreased trust and potentially lower adoption or user abandonment.

```solidity
function _repay(DataTypes.Market storage m, address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256)
    {
     ....
        require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
    ...
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Take the amount from liquidator, use it to repay the borrowed amount, refunds surplus to liquidator/repayers is an easier way of doing a repayment for borrowed funds

```solidity
    function _repay(DataTypes.Market storage m, address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256)
    {
        ...
        uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, to); //E (b.borrowBalance * m.borrowIndex) / b.borrowIndex;
        
        if (amount > borrowBalance) { 
            amountToRefund = amount - borrowBalance;
            amountRepaid = borrowBalance;
        }
        else { 
            amountToRefund = 0; 
            amountRepaid =  amount;
        }

        uint256 newUserBorrowBalance;
        uint256 newTotalBorrow;
        unchecked {
            newUserBorrowBalance = borrowBalance - amountRepaid;
            // Underflow not possible: amount <= userBorrow <= totalBorrow
            newTotalBorrow = m.totalBorrow - amountRepaid;
        }
        ....
        IERC20(market).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
        if (amountToRefund > 0) { IERC20(market).safeTransfer(from, amountToRefund);}

        emit Repay(market, from, to, amount, newUserBorrowBalance, newTotalBorrow);

        return amount;
    }
```
