# Did Not Approve To Zero First

## Summary
Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value.They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.


## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.
## Impact
unsafe ERC20 approve that do not handle non-standard erc20 behavior.
1.Some token contracts do not return any value.
2.Some token contracts revert the transaction when the allowance is not zero.
