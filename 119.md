# IronBank allows deposits into markets that are not seizable

## Summary
IronBank allows deposits into markets that are not seizable allowing the user to borrow funds without the risk of being liquidated

## Vulnerability Detail
A position can only be liquidated if the underlying collateral is seizable:
```sol
    function liquidate(
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        address marketBorrow,
        address marketCollateral,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(liquidator) {
        // ...
        require(isMarketSeizable(mCollateral), "collateral market cannot be seized");
        // ...
    }

    function isMarketSeizable(DataTypes.Market storage m) internal view returns (bool) {
        return !m.config.isTransferPaused() && m.config.liquidationThreshold > 0;
    }
```

A market is not seizable if the transfer of IBTokens is disabled or the liquidation threshold is 0. But, that doesn't prevent users from supplying more assets to that market to borrow additional funds.

`supply()` only checks whether the supply function is paused:

```sol
    function supply(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        isAuthorized(from)
    {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
        require(!m.config.isSupplyPaused(), "supply paused");
        require(!isCreditAccount(to), "cannot supply to credit account");
        // ...
    }
```

## Impact
Since unseizable markets are unfit to be used as collateral (can't be liquidated), you expose the protocol to potentially unhealthy debt.

A user can increase their collateral position to borrow additional funds without risking liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`supply()` should not allow you to deposit additional funds into a market if it's unseizable.
