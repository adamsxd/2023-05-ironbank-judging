# TxBuilderExtension.supplyNativeToken uses msg.value

## Summary
TxBuilderExtension.supplyNativeToken and repayNativeToken uses msg.value. In case if both of them are used at some set of transactions, then call will revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
`TxBuilderExtension.supplyNativeToken` function sends all `msg.value` to the weth contract and then supplies it to the IronBank. Also `msg.value`  is used inside `repayNativeToken` function. In case if both of them are used at some set of transactions, then call will revert.
## Impact
Actions set with native token supply and repay will revert.
