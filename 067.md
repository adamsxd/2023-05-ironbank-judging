# Chainlink's latestRoundData return stale or incorrect result for L1

## Summary
No checks if the price returned by the chainlink oracle is up to date

## Vulnerability Detail
In PriceOracle.sol the call `latestRoundData()` is used but from the returned date only the price is checked and the values `updatedAt`, `roundID` and `timestamp` are ignored. This can lead to stale prices for the assets involved and can, depending on the circumstances, lead to liquidations of users that should not be liquidated.

Example: (for simplicity variables like liquidation threshold and collateralFactor are ignored)

The function `IronBank.liquidate()` is called on a user who has deposited TokenA currenty worth 2500 USD and borrowed tokenB currently worth 2300 USD. This liquidation attempt should normally fail, but if the oracle returns the stale price of 2000 USD for TokenA and the updated price of 2300USD for tokenB the user will be liquidated since the calculated debt is higher than his deposits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use all data returned from the Oracle and add the below check for returned data

`function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 timestamp, uint256 updatedAt, )= registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
 //Solution
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }`
