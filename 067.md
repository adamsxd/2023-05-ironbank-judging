# Users should be able to exit the market from the redeem function if userSupply == ibTokenAmount but amount < type(uint256).max

## Summary

The `redeem()` function allows a user to withdraw their tokens from the protocol. If the user inputs an amount of `type(uint256).max)`  which will set ` isRedeemFull = true` allowing the user to exist the market. But this is not the case for amount < type(uint256).max)`. Users should still be able to exit in this case. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `redeem()` function allows a user to withdraw their tokens from the protocol. If the user inputs an amount of `type(uint256).max)` then ` isRedeemFull = true` because ` ibTokenAmount = userSupply;`  and the user is able to exit the market. However if the user inputs an amount < `type(uint256).max)` then they may still be in the market ...but this calculation ` `ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m); ` can equate to ` ibTokenAmount = userSupply`  which should therefore allow the user to exit the market. 

This code snippet checks the input amount from the user

```solidity
        uint256 ibTokenAmount;
        bool isRedeemFull;
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            ibTokenAmount = userSupply;
            amount = (ibTokenAmount * _getExchangeRate(m)) / 1e18;
            isRedeemFull = true;
        } else {
            ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);
        }

```

It is possible for the result of    `ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);`  to be equal to  `ibTokenAmount = userSupply` as is the case when `amount == type(uint256).max`

The function does not check if this is true, as such  `isRedeemFull` will not be set to `true` and the user will not be exited from the market here:

```solidity
      // Check if need to exit the market.
        if (isRedeemFull && _getBorrowBalance(m, from) == 0) {
            _exitMarket(market, from);
        }
```

## Impact

User will not be appropriately existed from the market if they do not input an amount `amount == type(uint256).max`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if `ibTokenAmount = userSupply` after this calculation `ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);` in `redeem` so the user can exit the market in the case where amount < type(uint256).max


```solidity

   if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            ibTokenAmount = userSupply;
            amount = (ibTokenAmount * _getExchangeRate(m)) / 1e18;
            isRedeemFull = true;
        } else {
            ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);    
              if(ibTokenAmount = userSupply){
                 isRedeemFull = true;
              }
        }
```
This will allow the user to therefor exit the market. As is the appropriate behaviour when ibTokenAmount = userSupply
