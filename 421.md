# Disable Liquidate function

## Summary
If the loop of the array in the check exceeds the gas limit when determining if the condition is liquidable or not, it is always revert and the liquidation condition cannot be checked.
## Vulnerability Detail
IronBank's `isLiquidatable` function loops through the `allEnteredMarkets[user]` array. However, this array is added elements in the `_enterMarket` function with no upper limit.
Therefore, if the gas limit of the block is exceeded, the function cannot be invoked and the condition of liquidatable or not cannot be determined.
## Impact
If the value of the collateral is lower than the value of the debt, it cannot be liquidated and a bad debt is created.
