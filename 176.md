# Incorrect oracle price will pass when chainlink data hit minimum answer

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators have a circuit breaker mechanism and if the price of an asset goes outside of a price range that is set ahead of time. The oracle will continue to return minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In PriceOracle.sol, chainlink is the only oracle used. And only the non-zero price is checked.
```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(
        address base,
        address quote
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price, , , ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return
            uint256(price) *
            10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```
ChainlinkFeedRegistry pulls the associated aggregator and requests round data from it. ChainlinkAggregators have minPrice and maxPrice circuit breakers built into them. If a price drops below the minPrice, the protocol will still report the minPrice. Users can then take out huge amounts of bad debt and bankrupt the protocol.
## Impact
In LUNA crash, this is exactly what happens, huge amount of borrowing leading to bad debts when chainlink reports a higher price than market price. The protocol can be manipulated to give out loans at an inflated price.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a secondary on-chain liquidity-based oracle like Uniswap TWAP to check for the price difference. Revert when price difference is too high.
