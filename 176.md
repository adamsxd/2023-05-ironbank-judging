# Flashloan contract will become unnusable for tokens like USDT

## Summary
- The flashloan contract could become unusable for tokens like USDT because the allowance is never reset to 0

## Vulnerability Detail
- When the flashloan contract calls for the first time the `_loan()`  it will [approve the IronBank to spend the max amount of tokens possible on behalf of the Flashloan contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/flashLoan/FlashLoan.sol#L106-L109), and after increasing the allowance, the flashloan calls the [IronBank.repay()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L460-L470) where it **never resets the unspent allowance to 0.**
- For tokens like USDT that do not allow approving an amount `M > 0` when an existing amount `N > 0` is already approved will cause that from the second transfer onwards all the transactions will revert because of the approval race condition in the ERC20's contract.


## Impact
- The flashloan contract could become unusable for tokens like USDT after the first flashloan operation because the **allowance is never reset to 0**

## Recommendation
- As per [this blog by OpenZeppellin](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/explain-the-practical-use-of-increaseallowance-and-decreaseallowance-functions-on-erc20/15103), the recommended approach when dealing with approvals is to use `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()`.
- Adopt a safer approach to cover edge cases such as the above mentioned USDT token and implement a similar solution as the following:
```solidity
function _loan(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, address token, uint256 amount, bytes memory data, address msgSender)
    internal
{
    ...

    uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), ironBank);
    if (allowance < amount) {
+       if (allowance > 0) {
+           // Reset allowance to 0 before attempting to increase it
+           IERC20(token).safeDecreaseAllowance(ironBank, allowance);
+       }
+       IERC20(token).safeIncreaseAllowance(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
    }

    ...
}
```
