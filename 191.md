# Potential Overflow in `getBorrowRate` Function

## Summary
In the `TripleSlopeRateModel` contract, the `getBorrowRate` function is vulnerable to potential integer overflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getBorrowRate` function performs various mathematical operations that involve multiplication and division of uint256 numbers. Since these operations are not done in an `unchecked` block, it is theoretically possible for an overflow to occur if the input values are sufficiently large.

## Impact
An integer overflow could lead to unpredictable and incorrect results from the `getBorrowRate` function. If these incorrect results are used in subsequent operations, it could compromise the integrity of the DeFi protocol.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function getBorrowRate(uint256 cash, uint256 borrow) public view returns (uint256) {
    ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the SafeMath library or similar arithmetic libraries for all arithmetic operations to prevent possible overflow or underflow scenarios. Additionally, include proper checks and bounds for input values, ensuring that they are within a reasonable and safe range.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy `TripleSlopeRateModel` contract on a local testnet or Ethereum mainnet fork using Hardhat or Truffle, passing appropriate parameters to the constructor.
2. Call the `getBorrowRate` function with very large `cash` and `borrow` values.
3. Note that due to the large input values, an integer overflow may occur resulting in incorrect calculation results.
