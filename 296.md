# XDZIBEC-onDeferredLiquidityCheck function takes a bytes parameter

## Summary
- The `onDeferredLiquidityCheck` function in the  `DeferLiquidityCheckInterface` interface takes a `bytes` parameter. The` bytes` type is a dynamic type, which means that the size of the data passed in by the caller is not known at compile time. This can be exploit by an attacker and lead to pass in a large `amount` of data that could crash the contract or cause other unintended behavior.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
interface DeferLiquidityCheckInterface {
    /**
     * @dev The callback function that deferLiquidityCheck will invoke.
     * @param data The arbitrary data that was passed in by the caller
     */
    function onDeferredLiquidityCheck(bytes memory data) external;
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the` DeferLiquidityCheckInterface` interface, so the problem here is in the` onDeferredLiquidityCheck` function is declared. The function is declared to take a `bytes` parameter, but the `bytes` type is not a valid type for a function parameter. The `bytes` type is a dynamic type, which means that the size of the data passed in by the caller is not known at compile time. This can exploit by an attacker and lead to pass in a large amount of data that could crash the contract or cause other unintended behavior.
## Impact
- The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to crash the contract or cause other unintended behavior.
- The vulnerability could be used to steal funds from the contract.
- The vulnerability could be used to manipulate the contract's behavior.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Change the `bytes` parameter in the `onDeferredLiquidityCheck` function to a `bytes32` parameter.
- The `bytes32` type is a `fixed-size` type, which means that the` size` of the data passed in by the caller is known at compile time. This makes the function more secure and less likely to be exploited by an attacker.
