# `delistMarket` deletes the market, but does not clear `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` mappings

## Summary
`IronBank.delistMarket` delists a market from `markets` mapping and `allMarkets` array, but that is not enough because `market.userBorrows` mapping and `market.userSupplies` are not deleted and will be still in contract storage.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function delistMarket(address market) external onlyMarketConfigurator {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        delete markets[market]; 
        allMarkets.deleteElement(market);

        emit MarketDelisted(market);
    }

```
Line `delete markets[market]` will delete `markets[market]` but will not delete `markets[market].userBorrows` and `markets[market].userSupplies`

This will cause an issue if a delisted market gets listed back once again - `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` will still be the same ones as before and it will not be empty.

## Impact
`IronBank.delistMarket` doesn't fully clear `market` storage - `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` are not removed. This will cause an issue if the same market gets listed back.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Arrays `allUserSupplies` and `allUserBorrows` should be saved in the market data. In that way the whole `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` can be successfully cleared.

```solidity
    function delistMarket(address market) external onlyMarketConfigurator {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < m.allUserSupplies.length; i++) {
             delete m.userSupplies[m.allUserSupplies[i]]
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < m.allUserBorrows.length; i++) {
             delete m.userBorrows[m.allUserBorrows[i]]
        }
 
        delete markets[market];
        allMarkets.deleteElement(market);

        emit MarketDelisted(market);
    }
```
