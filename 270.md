# XDZIBEC-unchecked keyword in deleteElement() function can be exploited by malicious contracts

## Summary
- The `unchecked` keyword in the` deleteElement()` function allows malicious contracts to inject code into the function. This can be used to steal funds, take control of contracts, or perform other malicious actions.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   function deleteElement(address[] storage self, address element) internal {
        uint256 count = self.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < count;) {
            if (self[i] == element) {
                if (i != count - 1) {
                    self[i] = self[count - 1];
                }
                self.pop();
                break;
            }

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- There is a bug in the `deleteElement()` function, the problem is in the line unchecked `{     i++;`  tells Solidity to ignore any errors that might occur when incrementing the `i` variable. This could exploit by an attacker and allows malicious contracts to inject code into the `deleteElement()` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- it's should do this : 
```solidity 
require(i < count, "Index out of bounds");
i++;
```
- This line of code will check to make sure that the `i` variable is less than the length of the array before incrementing it. This will prevent malicious contracts from injecting code into the `deleteElement()` function.
