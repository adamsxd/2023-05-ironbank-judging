# Liquidations could be DOSed by IronBank.sol#_IsLiquidatable loop over unbounded array

## Summary
Liquidations could be DOSed by IronBank.sol#_IsLiquidatable loop over an unbounded array 
## Vulnerability Detail
The liquidate() function uses the `_isLiquidatable` function in its body:
```solidity
function liquidate()  {
//Edited to code to show only the part I am talking about

        // Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
        require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");
``` 
However, the function _isLiquidatable loops over the unbounded `userEnteredMarkets` array:
```solidity
function _isLiquidatable(address user) internal view returns (bool) {
//not related code

        address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
            if (!m.config.isListed) {
                continue;
            }

//not related code
}
``` 
which can run out of gas if the array of `userEnteredMarkets` becomes too big.
## Impact
A malicious user could enter a lot of markets, making himself basically unable to be liquidated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a limit on how many markets a user can enter and make sure that with this limit there's no risk of running out of gas.
