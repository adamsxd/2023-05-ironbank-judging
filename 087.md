# PriceOracle.sol#getPrice() - double price decimals adjusting could lead to higher prices on tokens with <18 decimals

## Summary
The getPrice function in PriceOracle.sol adjusts the price(or "normalizes" it as it's called in the code) to 18 decimals. 

However, it is done twice, which will cause problems for tokens with <18 decimals.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take for example WBTC which has 8 decimals and take a look at the getPrice function:
```solidity
function getPrice(address asset) external view returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == wsteth) {
            //asset is not wsteth so this code is not relevant
        }

        AggregatorInfo memory aggregatorInfo = aggregators[asset];
        uint256 price = getPriceFromChainlink(aggregatorInfo.base, aggregatorInfo.quote);

        if (aggregatorInfo.quote == Denominations.ETH) {
            //price is not ETH based so this code is not relevant
        }

        return getNormalizedPrice(price, asset);
    }
``` 
Let's take a look at the `price` variable which gets its value from the `getPriceFromChainlink` function below:
```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
``` 
Because of the return, and as the comments specify, the price returned will be in 18 decimals. So it returns the price of WBTC = x * 1e18

After this, in the initial `getPrice` function we return `getNormalizedPrice(price, asset)`.
Notice that the price here is already extended to 18 decimals, so it's x * 1e18.

Here is the `getNormalizedPrice` function:
```solidity
function getNormalizedPrice(uint256 price, address asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(asset).decimals();
        return price * 10 ** (18 - decimals);
    }
``` 
Here the variable `decimals` will return 8 in the case of WBTC, or something else in the case of any other token with <18 decimals.

Then we return price * 10 ** (18 - 8) = price * 10 ** 10

But the price is already extended to 18 decimals so this will return:
x * 1e18 * 1e10 = x * 1e28
## Impact
This results in the protocol assuming much higher prices of the supplied assets. Which can result in loss of funds, users borrowing against much less collateral than needed, etc.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Normalize the prices to 18 decimals only in one place. For example, in the `getNormalizedPrice`. Remove the normalizing in the `getPriceFromChainlink` function.
