# XDZIBEC-getUtilization function does not use the cash parameter.

## Summary
- The `getUtilization` function in the `InterestRateModelInterface` interface does not use the `cash` parameter. This means that the `getUtilization` function can be called with any value for the cash parameter, even if it is zero. This could allow an attacker to call the `getUtilization` function and `get` a `utilization` percentage of `100%`, even if there is no cash in the system.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface InterestRateModelInterface {
    function getUtilization(uint256 cash, uint256 borrow) external pure returns (uint256);

    function getBorrowRate(uint256 cash, uint256 borrow) external view returns (uint256);

    function getSupplyRate(uint256 cash, uint256 borrow) external view returns (uint256);
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the InterestRateModelInterface interface , the problem is  in the line where the `getUtilization` function is declared. The function is declared to take two parameters: `cash` and `borrow`, the `cash` parameter is never used in the function. This is a vulnerability because it means that the `getUtilization` function can be called with any value for the `cash` parameter, even if it is `zero`. This could allow an attacker to call the `getUtilization` function and get a `utilization` percentage of `100%`, even if there is no cash in the system.
## Impact
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability:
    - The attacker creates a contract that implements the `InterestRateModelInterface` interface.
    - The attacker calls the `getUtilization` function with a value of `0` for the `cash` parameter.
    - The `getUtilization` function will return a value of `100`, even though there is no cash in the system.
    - The attacker can then use this value to make false claims about the health of the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  Remove the `cash` parameter from the `getUtilization` function.
- The `cash` parameter is not used in the `getUtilization` function, so it is not needed. Removing the `cash` parameter will make the `getUtilization` function more secure and less likely to be exploited by an attacker.
