# XDZIBEC-seize function does not use the amount parameter

## Summary
- The `seize` function in the `IBTokenInterface` interface does not use the `amount` parameter. This means that the `seize` function can be called with any value for the `amount` parameter, even if it is zero. This could allow an attacker to call the `seize `function and `transfer` `tokens` from one account to another without actually `transferring` any `tokens`.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
interface IBTokenInterface {
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;

    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external;

    function seize(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external;

    function asset() external view returns (address);
}
```
- The vulnerability  is in the `seize` function. The function is declared to take three parameters:` from, to, and amount`, the `amount` parameter is not used in the function, so the `seize` function can be called with any `value` for the `amount` parameter, even if it is zero. This could allow an attacker to call the `seize` function and `transfer tokens` from one account to another without actually transferring any tokens.
## Impact
- This an example of how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:
    - The attacker creates a contract that implements the `IBTokenInterface` interface.
    - The attacker calls the `seize` function with a value of `0` for the `amount` parameter.
    - The `seize` function will `transfer tokens` from the attacker's account to the contract's account, even though no tokens are actually being transferred.
    - The attacker can then use the `tokens` in the contract's account to do whatever they want.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Remove the `amount` parameter from the `seize` function.
- The `amount` parameter is not used in the seize function, so it is not needed. Removing the amount parameter will make the `seize` function more secure and less likely to be exploited by an attacker
