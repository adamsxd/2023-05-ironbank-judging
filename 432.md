# `_getBorrowBalance()` returning the amount in favor for borrower, protocol will get less amount interest

## Summary

`_getBorrowBalance()` returning the amount in favor for borrower, protocol will get less amount interest

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_getBorrowBalance()` function implemented to get the borrow balance of a user by multiplying user's borrowBalance to borrowIndex and then divided by user's borrowIndex.

The concern lies in the division. It should prioritize a rounded-up calculation that favors the protocol's interest rather than the user's, in order to achieve a higher overall result. In Solidity division rounds towards zero.

A simple minimal example case where the rounding down, would be like:
when user borrowAmount is 10.000, the market's borrowIndex 123111 and user's borrow index is 123100, then the exact result would be `10000.8936`, but since solidity rounds down, it will just return `10000`, so no iterest would be calculated.

## Impact

Protocol get less interest, borrower might pay less amount

```js
File: IronBank.sol
854:         return (b.borrowBalance * m.borrowIndex) / b.borrowIndex;
```

## Recommendation

Use a rounding up (or divCeil) when calculating the borrow balance
