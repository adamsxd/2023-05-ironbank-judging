# If Price falls to zero, liquidations will be frozen

## Summary
Liquidation function won't work if the price falls to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
Zero is unacceptable value when retrieving price from chainlink oracle. So if the price falls to zero, the liquidation process won't be triggered or simply "frozen" (all calls will revert). If this happens, collateral assets won't be liquidated and the protocol will be insolvent.

## Impact
Liquidations may not be possible at a time when the protocol needs them most. As a result, the value of user's asset may fall below their debts, turning off any liquidation incentive and pushing the protocol into insolvency.
