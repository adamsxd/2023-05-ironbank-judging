# Out of Gas Scenario due to Unbounded loops with Multiple external Calls in the TxBuilderExtension.sol .

[Function with Bug](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL141C1-L141C94)
## Summary
The execute function in the TxBuilderExtension.sol contract since it could be called by any amount in an array and makes multiple external calls.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the execute [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL100C1-L102C6) in the TxBuliderExtension.sol
```solidity  
   function execute(Action[] calldata actions) external payable {
        executeInternal(msg.sender, actions, 0);
    }
```
The executeInternal [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL140C3-L197C6)
```solidity
    function executeInternal(address user, Action[] memory actions, uint256 index) internal {
        for (uint256 i = index; i < actions.length;) {
            Action memory action = actions[i];
```

The function iterates over the actions array starting from the specified index. For each element in the array, it performs a specific action based on the name field of the Action structure, and for each  action, it makes certain external calls to the ironbank contract,
As you could see the function, doesn't provide a limit to the amount of iteration it should go, meaning if called through the execute [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#LL100C1-L102C6) with an arbitrary length of an array it could cause an out of gas secanrio when the contract will be in a state where the amount of gas it used will cause its transaction to never be added to a block due to the block gas limit. this will cause a Dos as it will always exceed the available gas limit per block

**POC**
```foundry
import "foundry.sol";

contract MyContract {
    function executeInternal(address user, Action[] memory actions, uint256 index) internal {
        // ... Implementation of executeInternal function
    }
    
    // ... Rest of the contract code
    
    // Function to be called by an attacker
    function attack() public {
        Action[] memory actions = new Action[](10);
        // Fill the actions array with a large number of ACTION_SUPPLY actions
        
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < actions.length; i++) {
            actions[i] = Action({
                name: ACTION_SUPPLY,
                data: abi.encode(address(this), 1)
            });
        }
        
        // Call executeInternal with the large actions array
        executeInternal(msg.sender, actions, 0);
    }
}

contract MyContractTest {
    using Foundry for *;

    function testDoSAttack() public {
        MyContract contractInstance = new MyContract();
        
        // Call the attack function to initiate the DoS attack
        contractInstance.attack().withGasLimit(2000000).execute();
    }
}
```

In this test case, we have a MyContract contract with an executeInternal function that performs various actions based on the input actions array. The attack function within MyContract simulates an attacker calling executeInternal with a large number of ACTION_SUPPLY actions.

In the MyContractTest contract, we use the foundry library to simulate the DoS attack. The testDoSAttack function deploys an instance of MyContract and calls the attack function, which triggers the execution of a large number of ACTION_SUPPLY actions.

By specifying a gas limit (in this case, 2,000,000) when executing the attack, we can observe the behavior of the contract under the given gas constraints.
## Impact
an attacker can deliberately consume a significant amount of computational resources to exhaust/ exceed the available gas This can be done by executing (via using an arbitrary length of array) functions in a way that causes them to consume excessive gas.

## Tool used

Manual Review Remix.IDE

## Recommendation.

Gas Limit: Ensure that the gas usage of the functions called within the loop is well-optimized and does not exceed the available gas limit per block.
Iteration Limit: Implement a limit on the number of iterations allowed in the loop to prevent potential abuse or excessive computation.
