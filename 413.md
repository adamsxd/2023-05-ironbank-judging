# It is not checked if sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
It is necessary to check if the sequencer is working correctly due to the possiblity of being down when using Chainlink in a L2 blockchain.

## Vulnerability Detail
As it has been stated on the contest [QA](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank) section, the contracts are going to be deployed in L2 chains, such as Arbitrum and Optism: 

`Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism``

Due to that, it is necessary to check if the sequencer is down when working with Chainlink price feeds.

Optimistic rollup protocols enable the transfer of all computational operations from the Layer 1 (L1) Ethereum chain to a Layer 2 (L2) chain. The actual execution takes place on the L2 chain, and the outcomes are subsequently sent back to the L1 chain. These protocols utilize a sequencer that handles and combines L2 transactions, consolidating multiple transactions into a single one. However, if the sequencer becomes inaccessible, it becomes impossible for users to access the read/write APIs they rely on, rendering applications on the L2 network inaccessible for most users. The only way to interact with these applications in such a scenario would be to directly engage with the L1 optimistic rollup contracts. Although the L2 chain remains operational, it would be unfair to continue offering services on your applications when only a privileged few can utilize them.
