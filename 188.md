# Missing Event Emits in IronBank.sol

## Summary

The IronBank.sol contract does not emit events for significant state changes. Events provide an easy way to monitor and track changes on the blockchain, and it is a good practice to emit events for any significant state changes.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Solidity, events are inheritable members of contracts and can be used to emit from inherited contracts. When you call them, they cause the arguments to be stored in the transactionâ€™s log - a special data structure in the blockchain. These logs are associated with the address of the contract, are incorporated into the blockchain, and stay there as long as a block is accessible.

In IronBank.sol, many functions that cause significant state changes do not emit events. Functions like `supply`, `borrow`, `repay`, `absorbToReserves`, `reduceReserves` etc., make significant state changes but do not emit events that reflect these changes.

## Impact

The absence of events can make it difficult to monitor and track the contract's activity. This can make debugging and analysis harder and can also make it harder for users and third-party services to track transactions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to emit events for any significant state changes, including transfers, approvals, supply changes, etc. This will improve the transparency of the contract operations and make it easier to monitor and debug the contract.

## Proof of Concept

As the issue is related to missing code, no steps are required to reproduce this issue. Simply review the IronBank.sol contract and observe that there are no events being emitted for significant state changes.
