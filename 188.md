# Potential for Unintended Privilege Escalation in CreditLimitManager.sol

## Summary

A potential vulnerability exists in the implementation of the `onlyOwnerOrGuardian` modifier. If improperly implemented, this could allow unauthorized users to manipulate the system.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `onlyOwnerOrGuardian` modifier in the `CreditLimitManager.sol` contract checks if the sender is either the owner or the guardian of the contract. However, there aren't any checks for whether the `guardian` address is set to a non-zero address. If the guardian is mistakenly set to the zero address (0x0), then any transaction sent from an address that has not been explicitly set could pass the `onlyOwnerOrGuardian` check.

```solidity
modifier onlyOwnerOrGuardian() {
        require(msg.sender == owner() || msg.sender == guardian, "!authorized");
        _;
    }
```

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow any address to execute functions that are supposed to be restricted to the owner or the guardian. This might allow malicious actors to manipulate credit limits or perform other unauthorized operations.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function setGuardian(address _guardian) external onlyOwner {
        guardian = _guardian;

        emit GuardianSet(guardian);
    }

function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 creditLimit) external onlyOwner {
        IronBankInterface(ironBank).setCreditLimit(user, market, creditLimit);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, add a requirement that the `_guardian` address passed to the `setGuardian` function must be a non-zero address.

```solidity
function setGuardian(address _guardian) external onlyOwner {
        require(_guardian != address(0), "Guardian address cannot be 0");
        guardian = _guardian;

        emit GuardianSet(guardian);
    }
```

## Proof Of Concept

A potential scenario would involve the owner mistakenly setting the guardian address to the zero address, and then a malicious user calling functions that should be restricted to the owner or guardian.
