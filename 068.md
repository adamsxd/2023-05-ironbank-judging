# No check on stale data in PriceOracle

## Summary
Chainlink's latestRoundData()is used but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:

https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds
## Vulnerability Detail
It's possible the data returned by the Chainlink oracle is not accurate or not recent and this means the protocol won't work properly when that happens.
## Impact
This will impact various functions that are dependent on the price. 
- `liquidate`
- `borrow`, `redeem`, `transferIBToken`, and `deferLiquidityCheck` via `_checkAccountLiquidity` -> `_getAccountLiquidity`
## Code Snippet
[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66)
```solidity
 function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price, , , ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the updatedAt, timestamp, and answer return values and check with a value that the protocol seems reasonable to accept.
Example:
```solidity
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(answer > 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");
       //maxDelayTime is a time in ms that the protocol is willing to accept as delay
        require(updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime, "stale price");
```
