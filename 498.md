# An attacker can borrow with out collateral and gain free tokens through reentrancy

## Summary
An attacker can borrow without collateral and gain free tokens through reentrancy  
## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can call `deferLiquidityCheck()` and it changes their status to `LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DEFERRED`
so when the callback happens call the same function but with a different user causing that other user to be checked and not the other user(attacker).
Steps:
1. Attacker  calls `deferLiquidityCheck(Alice)`
2. Attacker reenters with the callback `deferLiquidityCheck(bob)` and we do nothing so the function  would pass
3. Alice is `status=LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DEFERRED`
4. Alice can call borrow readily and borrow without worrying about collateral checks and cause bad debt in the protocol
## Impact
Bad debt, borrowing more funds than should be allowed
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        uint8 status = liquidityCheckStatus[user];

        if (status == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_NORMAL) {
            (uint256 collateralValue, uint256 debtValue) = _getAccountLiquidity(user);
            require(collateralValue >= debtValue, "insufficient collateral");
        } else if (status == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DEFERRED) {
            liquidityCheckStatus[user] = LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DIRTY;
        }

```
```solidity
  require(liquidityCheckStatus[user] == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_NORMAL, "reentry defer liquidity check");
        liquidityCheckStatus[user] = LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DEFERRED;
// @audit-issue here we would reenter with another user(user that is normal and has no collateral should pass)
        DeferLiquidityCheckInterface(msg.sender).onDeferredLiquidityCheck(data);

        uint8 status = liquidityCheckStatus[user];
        liquidityCheckStatus[user] = LIQUIDITY_CHECK_NORMAL;

        if (status == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DIRTY) {
            _checkAccountLiquidity(user);
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make this function based on msg.sender instead
```solidity
require(user==msg.sender);
// so msg.sender can only borrow for them selfs and flashloan with their own loss and not cause them to borrow more then they should
```
or non reentrant
