# After a market delisting, the credit account cannot be cleared and its operations are restricted in other markets.

## Summary
After a market delisting, the credit account cannot be cleared and its operations are restricted in other markets.
## Vulnerability Detail
To determine whether a user is a credit user, it is done by checking the length of their `allCreditMarkets`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L239-L241
```solidity
    function isCreditAccount(address user) public view returns (bool) {
        return allCreditMarkets[user].length > 0;
    }
```

The length of `allCreditMarkets` can only decrease when market is listed:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L634-L639
```solidity
    function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 credit) external onlyCreditLimitManager {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        if (credit == 0 && creditLimits[user][market] != 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].deleteElement(market);
```

This has led to the following situation:
1. The user has been set as a credit account in market1.
2. Market1 has been delisted but the users' credit has not been cleared accordingly.
3. After delisting, the user's credit for market1 cannot be changed unless the market is relisted.
4. This user will always be a credit account for other markets, even if his credit belongs to a delisted market. Some of the user's actions will be restricted, such as borrowing.

## Impact
This user will always be a credit account for other markets, even if his credit belongs to a delisted market. Some of the user's actions will be restricted, such as borrowing.

## Recommendation
Allow deletion of credit in delisted markets in `setCreditLimit`.
