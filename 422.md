# Flash loan feature not available on some tokens

## Summary
Some tokens (e.g. `UNI`, `COMP`) revert if the value passed to `approve`  is larger than `uint96`.
Flash loan feature will not be available for such tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_loan` function of `FlashLoan.sol`, set approve as `IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);`.
However, this exceeds `uint96`, so it always reverts for some tokens.
## Impact
Some tokens will not be able to use the flashloan feature.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the amount of approve to be specified.
