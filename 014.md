# Oracle price not check for accuracy

## Summary

Not check oracle price accuracy.

## Vulnerability Detail

Oracle prices can be outdated and inaccurate, and oracle prices have update cycles and threshold intervals. You should check the accuracy of the relevant data rather than simply reading the return value.       
This is closely related to the liquidation of users' funds, and the stale price may be used by the liquidator, causing losses to users.     

## Impact
