# SafeApprove require allowance is zero

## Summary

SafeApprove require allowance is zero, should use `forceApprove` instead of `safeApprove`.   

## Vulnerability Detail

For flashLoan, when repay contract will approve ironBank.    
```solidity
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(address(receiver), address(this), amount);

        uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), ironBank);
        if (allowance < amount) {
            IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
        }

        IronBankInterface(ironBank).repay(address(this), address(this), token, amount);
```
It starts with allowance of 0, which is less than repay amount, so it will approve ironBank `type(uint256).max`.     
Over a long period of flashloan, allowance is gradually reduced until it is eventually less than the repay amount, but greater than 0. Note that flashloan only limits tokens to market ERC20 tokens, it does not specify `transferFrom` does not reduce an allowance of `type(uint256).max`.           
When `safeApprove` is called again, due to the fact that allowance is not 0, the call will revert, and this token cannot be loaned thereafter, so it can be considered as permanent dos.     
```solidity
    function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }
```
Of course since `type(uint256).max` is a huge number which is fine for most tokens for a long time. But note again that the `totalSupply` of market tokens can be large, which has no limit.    

## Impact

Medium. If allowance is reduced to less than repay amount, flashloan this market token is not available.
