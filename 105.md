# Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability in Liquidation Check due to Excessive Market Entry

## Summary
The function _isLiquidatable() in IronBank.sol is designed to assess whether an account is liable for liquidation. However, it includes a vulnerability where a malicious user can avoid liquidation by entering an excessive number of markets, even with minimal participation (e.g., 1 wei in each market). The function iterates over all the markets the user has entered, and due to gas limits for transactions in the Ethereum network, it may fail to complete execution if the user has entered a large number of market

## Vulnerability Detail
 In the function _isLiquidatable(), there is a for loop that iterates over all markets the user has entered (userEnteredMarkets). Each iteration involves fetching data and performing calculations, operations which consume gas. If a user enters a large number of markets, the total gas consumed by this function may exceed the block gas limit. As a result, any transaction involving this function would always fail, effectively rendering the user immune to liquidation.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant. It not only allows a malicious user to avoid liquidation but also potentially disrupts the entire lending platform. The exploit allows users to borrow assets without the expected level of risk for the platform. This risk distortion can impact the platform's stability and functionality.

### POC

Reading from storage: ~200 gas units
Writing to storage: ~5,000 gas units
Basic computation (addition, subtraction): ~3 gas units
Complex computation (multiplication, division): ~5 gas units

The `_isLiquidatable` function includes several operations:

It reads from storage (userEnteredMarkets array length, market configuration, user supply, borrow balance, asset price, etc.)
It performs complex computations (multiplication, division). Suppose we assume each iteration consumes around 50,000 gas units, this would allow for ~200 market entries within a single block if only this function were called.
However it's not the case, this function is called in a chain of calls to other functions like `_accrueInterest()` which also make some external calls and consume additional gas. Therefore, to be on the safe side, a more conservative limit on the number of market entries per user could be implemented, such as 50-60 markets.
It is important to reminder that to enter a market only 1 wei is needed.


## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L1070
```solidity
function` _isLiquidatable(address user) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 liquidationCollateralValue;
        uint256 debtValue;

        address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
            if (!m.config.isListed) {
                continue;
            }

            uint256 supplyBalance = m.userSupplies[user];
            uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, user);

            uint256 assetPrice = PriceOracleInterface(priceOracle).getPrice(userEnteredMarkets[i]);
            require(assetPrice > 0, "invalid price");
            uint256 liquidationThreshold = m.config.liquidationThreshold;
            if (supplyBalance > 0 && liquidationThreshold > 0) {
                uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(m);
                liquidationCollateralValue +=
                    (supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * liquidationThreshold) / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE;
            }
            if (borrowBalance > 0) {
                debtValue += (borrowBalance * assetPrice) / 1e18;
            }
        }
        return debtValue > liquidationCollateralValue;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this issue, the smart contract could enforce a limit on the number of markets a user can enter. This limit should be set considering the gas consumption of the _isLiquidatable() function to ensure it can always complete within the block gas limit, regardless of the number of markets a user has entered. Alternatively, consider refactoring the function to reduce its gas consumption, perhaps by changing how data is stored or accessed. Also, consider using a gas-efficient data structure for storing user's entered markets.
