# Griefing can be performed to make User's use of main IronBank functions more gas expensive

## Summary

A User's supply in IronBank is represented as IBTokens, which can be transferred arbitrarily between users like any other tokens. New users receiving IBTokens are added to the IBToken's corresponding market if they have not interacted with it before.

Malicious users can transfer their IBTokens from multiple different markets to a victim user in order to increase the gas cost of the victim's transactions that involve the use of IronBank's main functions by increasing the length of their corresponding `allEnteredMarkets` array.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `IronBank`, whenever a user interacts with a market for the first time, the market is added to the `allEnteredMarkets` array. This array is involved in multiple functions, but particularly the `_isLiquidatable()` and `_getAccountLiquidity()` functions loop over this array to aggregate the user's collateral value from every market they are a part of.

A User's supply in IronBank is represented as an ERC-20-compliant `IBToken` and any user that owns this token can call the standard `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions to send these to another user. These actions signal `IronBank` about the transfer, thus different checks are done to ensure consistency on the `from` user's account. However, the `to` user is now receiving a new token that represents a supply on a particular market, so if the user has not interacted with the market before, `_enterMarket()` is called, adding the market to the user's `allEnteredMarkets` array.

Given that `_isLiquidatable()` and `_getAccountLiquidity()` are internal functions that are involved in main protocol functions such as `borrow()`, `redeem()` and `liquidate()`; and need to loop over the `allEnteredMarkets` array, the more markets a user is a part of, the more expensive these functions become. 

A malicious user can take advantage of this by sending as little as 1 wei of their different `IBToken`s to a victim user, making them a part of a new market and increasing the gas cost of the victim user's use of the previously mentioned IronBank external functions.

Considering that for a market to be added to the user's `allEnteredMarkets` array the market needs to be listed, a malicious user is not able to spam arbitrary market addresses to put the victim user into a DoS state in which these functions reach the gas limit. However, it is worth noting that the more markets are listed on IronBank as time goes on, the more markets the malicious user will have at their disposal to perform this gas griefing attack and thus make executions more expensive. I don't consider that IronBank can legitimately list enough markets for a DoS to be plausible, but the user is still able to be griefed given the current implementation.

## Impact

Malicious users can transfer their IBTokens from multiple different markets to a victim user to increase the gas cost of the victim's use of IronBank's main functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 

I would suggest turning the IBToken transfer into a two-step process, where the user signals their intent to transfer their IBTokens to another user, but only finalizing the transfer once the `to` user has called a new `acceptIBTokenTransfer()` function.

Although this would break ERC-20's expected behaviour, the fact that IBTokens represent a User's supply in IronBank should probably not be handled as freely as it is right now.

Alternatively, an escrow could be implemented to "hold" the IBTokens until the `to` user has called `acceptIBTokenTransfer()`, this way the `from` user would not be able to "use" their IBTokens unless the `to` user rejects them / times out.
