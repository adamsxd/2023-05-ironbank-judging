# Liquidation Pause Can be Bypassed

## Summary
The protocol implements borrow pause, supply pause and token transfer pause. However, this implementation is insufficient to ensure pausing for liquidation.
## Vulnerability Detail
There are three pause flags for the protocol - supply, borrow and transfer in PauseFlags.sol. In IronBank.sol, the transfer pause flag is partially implemented in `liquidate()`, and `isMarketSeizable()`. In `isMarketSeizable()`, only collateral market token transfer is checked along with collateral market token `liquidationThreshold`. 
```solidity
//IronBank.sol
//liquidate()
        require(mBorrow.config.isListed, "borrow market not listed");
        require(mCollateral.config.isListed, "collateral market not listed");
>>>>    require(
            isMarketSeizable(mCollateral),
            "collateral market cannot be seized"
        );
      require(!isCreditAccount(borrower), "cannot liquidate credit account");
        require(liquidator != borrower, "cannot self liquidate");

        _accrueInterest(marketBorrow, mBorrow);
        _accrueInterest(marketCollateral, mCollateral);

        // Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
        require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");

        // Repay the debt.
        repayAmount = _repay(
            mBorrow,
            liquidator,
            borrower,
            marketBorrow,
            repayAmount
        );
       ...
```
```solidity
//IronBank.sol
    function isMarketSeizable(
        DataTypes.Market storage m
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        return
            !m.config.isTransferPaused() && m.config.liquidationThreshold > 0;
    }
```
However, there is no check on whether the borrow token market is paused or not. There are many urgent situations where protocol might need to pause a market, one of the most common situations is erroneous price oracle reporting which can happen to both the borrow token and collateral token. When the borrow token market's price is not reported accurately, the borrower's account could be at risk of liquidation as well. For example, when a borrower's debt underlying token is overvalued by the oracle, the borrower's account can be liquidated, even though based on the actual market price, the borrower is still safe.

An example of the situation is[ Dai/USDC depegs](https://rekt.news/coinbase-the-oracle/) which causes $110 million of loan liquidations on Compound. Dai was priced much higher than USDC creating a spike either due to oracle malfunction or manipulation, and this leads to whale borrowers eligible to be liquidated at an unfair valuation for their Dai debts.

In such case, even when borrow, supply and transfer for Dai is paused. Dai borrowers can still be liquidated, because liquidators can always `_repay` debts, and as long as the liquidator choose a collateral market token owned by the borrower that is not on pause. Liquidation will go through, causing users to be unfairly liquidated. 

## Impact
The protocol is at risk of potential mass liquidation due to erroneous price reporting of borrow underlying token, causing user to be liquidated unfairly.

## Recommendation
Consider adding liquidation pause flag and `_isLiquidationAllowed`for the borrow token market in `liquidate()`.
