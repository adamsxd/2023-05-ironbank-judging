# FlashLoan contract is not EIP-3156 compliant

## Summary

The FlashLoan contract is not EIP-3156 compliant, which can cause issues with external integrations

## Vulnerability Detail

The FlashLoan contract is intended to be EIP-3156 compliant, but is not. Specifically, the EIP-3156 standard indicates: (1) "If a `token` is not currently supported `maxFlashLoan` MUST return 0, instead of reverting", and (2) "If the token is not supported `flashFee` MUST revert". Both of these cases are not implemented correctly.

In the `maxFlashLoan` function, the condition is checked as:
```solidity
if (!IronBankInterface(ironBank).isMarketListed(token)) {
	return 0;
}
```

In the `flashFee` function, the condition is checked as:
```solidity
require(IronBankInterface(ironBank).isMarketListed(token), "token not listed");
```

The issue in both of these implementations is that they don't check if borrowing has been halted for the market, thus not correctly implementing the conditions in EIP-3156. When the market has its borrowing paused, it will be impossible to take flash loans, therefore meaning the market is not supported.

## Impact

The FlashLoan contract does not correctly comply with the EIP-3156 standard, which can cause issues with external integrations

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In both the `maxFlashLoan` and `flashFee` functions, check that borrowing has not been paused for the market associated with the `token`.
