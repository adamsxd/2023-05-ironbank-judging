# Malicious users can steal excess ETH in the UniswapExtension and TxBuilderExtension contracts

## Summary

A malicious user can steal any excess ETH which is stored in the UniswapExtension and TxBuilderExtension contracts due to `msg.value` not being cached.

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to incorrect user behavior, there can be excess ETH contained within the UniswapExtension and TxBuilderExtension contracts. For example, a user might accidentally send ETH directly to the contract, which will not revert given the `receive` function. There is a `seizeNative` function which is intended to be called to rescue user funds when this happens. The issue is that a malicious user is able to steal any excess ETH in the contract prior to the admin being able to rescue these funds. 

This is because (using the TxBuilderExtension as the example) the `execute`, and subsequently the `executeInternal` function accepts an array of actions to take. One potential action that can be taken is `ACTION_SUPPLY_NATIVE_TOKEN`, which will trigger a call to `supplyNativeToken`. In the `supplyNativeToken` function, they supply the user an amount equal to `msg.value`:
```solidity
ironBank.supply(address(this), user, weth, msg.value);
```
This is an issue because a malicious user can take the following step to steal excess ETH in the contract (assume there is 1 ETH in the contract):
1. call `execute` with an array of actions which will trigger `ACTION_SUPPLY_NATIVE_TOKEN` twice with 1 ETH as the value

In the first call, it will correctly use the ETH provided by the malicious user. However, on the second call it will use the 1 ETH which is trapped in the contract. Thus, the malicious user is able to steal the ETH.

## Impact

A malicious user is able to steal any excess ETH from the UniswapExtension and TxBuilderExtension contracts prior to any admin being able to rescue the funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `msg.value` value should be cached at the start of the `executeInternal` function call, and should be passed to all relevant functions, rather than those functions using `msg.value` directly.
