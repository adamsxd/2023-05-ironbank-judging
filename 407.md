# Funds could be stolen from `TxBuilderExtension.sol` and `UniswapExtension.sol` due to improper use of `msg.value`

## Summary
Since `TxBuilderExtension.sol` and `UniswapExtension.sol`  implement `seize` and `seizeNative`, which are operated by the admins, it is presumably expected for them to hold some funds (either fees or accidentally locked by users). However, these funds could be stolen by other users through maliciously crafted transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example:
[`TxBuilderExtension`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol) has 2 ETH in it.

Here's how to steal the funds:
 -  craft an `Action` which calls `supplyNativeToken(address user)` in `executeInternal()`
 - make an array of the same transaction 3 times, input it in with `msg.value: 1 eth` and call [`execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L100-L102)
```jsx
    function execute(Action[] calldata actions) external payable {
        executeInternal(msg.sender, actions, 0);
    }
```
Now `executeInternal()` will call  [`supplyNativeToken(<your address>)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L252-L256) 3 times with  `msg.value: 1 eth` and in tern deposit 3 ETH into the WETH portal. Which is 3 ETH in total, but only 1 ETH will be from your wallet (since you have only send 1 ETH with the initial call to `execute()`), while the remaining 2 ETH will come from the funds of `TxBuilderExtension`.
At the end, your position in Iron Bank will be 3 ETH, but only 1 ETH will be from your wallet and 2 will be from `TxBuilderExtension` funds.

Same could be done with `UniswapExtension.supplyNativeToken()`
## Impact
Funds could be drained from  `TxBuilderExtension.sol`
## Code Snippet
```jsx
    function supplyNativeToken(address user) internal nonReentrant {
        WethInterface(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();  //deposit 1 ETH 3 times 
        IERC20(weth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(ironBank), msg.value);
        ironBank.supply(address(this), user, weth, msg.value);  //then supply your position 3 times
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this, put `msg.value` in the `Action`, so it can be assigned separately with each action the user makes. Also make sure all of the amounts for every auction are <= `msg.value` 
```jsx
    struct Action {
        bytes32 name;
        bytes data;
 +      uint256 amount;
    }
```
