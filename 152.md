# Liquidation Threshold can be set without Collateral Factor Check

## Summary

`adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold()` allows the adjustment of the liquidation threshold without a corresponding check to ensure that the new liquidation threshold is not set lower than the existing collateral factor. This could potentially create an unstable financial system, where users become immediately eligible for liquidation upon borrowing.

## Vulnerability Detail
Collateral factor determines the maximum amount that a user can borrow against their collateral, while the liquidation threshold indicates when a loan becomes risky and therefore eligible for liquidation.
In the provided code, the function adjustMarketCollateralFactor() rightly ensures that the collateral factor does not exceed the liquidation threshold. However, the function adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold() lacks a similar check to ensure that the new liquidation threshold is not lower than the current collateral factor.

## Impact
It could lead to an imbalance in the lending system, jeopardizing the financial security of the borrowers by making their loans immediately eligible for liquidation.

```solidity
    function adjustMarketCollateralFactor(address market, uint16 collateralFactor) external onlyOwner {
        ...
        if (collateralFactor > 0) {
            require(collateralFactor <= MAX_COLLATERAL_FACTOR, "invalid collateral factor");
            require(
                collateralFactor <= config.liquidationThreshold, "collateral factor larger than liquidation threshold"
            );
        }
       ...
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As an improvement to the existing system, a check should be introduced in adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold() to ensure that the new liquidation threshold is not set lower than the current collateral factor. This check would align with the one already present in adjustMarketCollateralFactor(), ensuring that the collateral factor does not exceed the liquidation threshold. This additional check would further solidify the system, making it more secure and less susceptible to potential attacks or exploitation.
