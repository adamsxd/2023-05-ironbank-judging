# Liquidation Failure

## Summary
Throughout the codebase, there are many points at which a user liquidation can potentially fail. This means the bad position can not be curb and it will incur further loss for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Firstly, we have reverts present in the price oracle, which should be handled differently
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L68
- Also in the Liquidate function and internal calls
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L1065-L1092

## Impact
This directly stops liquidation calls for a user, cause a DOS on that account and for the liquidator and also bad debt for the protocol


## Code Snippet
```solidity

function liquidate(
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        address marketBorrow,
        address marketCollateral,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(liquidator) {
        DataTypes.Market storage mBorrow = markets[marketBorrow];
        DataTypes.Market storage mCollateral = markets[marketCollateral];
        require(mBorrow.config.isListed, "borrow market not listed");
        require(mCollateral.config.isListed, "collateral market not listed");
        require(isMarketSeizable(mCollateral), "collateral market cannot be seized");
        require(!isCreditAccount(borrower), "cannot liquidate credit account");
        require(liquidator != borrower, "cannot self liquidate");

        _accrueInterest(marketBorrow, mBorrow);
        _accrueInterest(marketCollateral, mCollateral);

        // Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
        require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

All functions called internally and externally for liquidation to happen should be handled with if statements such that they do not revert.
