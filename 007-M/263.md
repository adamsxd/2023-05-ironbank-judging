# It is not possible to get WBTC price in Ethereum mainnet

## Summary

It is not possible to get WBTC price in Ethereum mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail

WBTC is listed in the README as one of the supported assets. However, with the current implementation of `OraclePrice:getPrice()` it is not possible to get the price of WBTC in Ethereum mainnet, as there is no Chainlink WBTC/USD price feed.

## Impact

In the best-case scenario, WBTC market will not be available. 
In the worst-case scenario, BTC/USD price feed will be used. Given that the price of WBTC can be significantly different from the price of BTC, this can lead to the value of WBTC being over or underestimated, which can lead to arbitrage opportunities.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

When `asset` is WBTC, query both BTC/USD and WBTC/BTC price feeds and calculate the WBTC/USD price.
