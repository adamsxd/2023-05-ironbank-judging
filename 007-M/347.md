# PriceOracle use BTC/USD chainlink oracle to price WBTC which is problematic if WBTC depegs

## Summary
According to the sponsor, the protocol is using BTC/USD oracle is used to price WBTC, which would be problematic if WBTC depegs.
## Vulnerability Detail
WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) functions as a bridged asset, meaning it represents Bitcoin on another blockchain. If the bridge connecting WBTC and Bitcoin is compromised or fails, it can result in WBTC losing its peg to Bitcoin and no longer being equivalent to it. This situation would have significant consequences, particularly in the context of borrowing against WBTC. Since the protocol still values WBTC based on the BTC/USD exchange rate, it would lead to substantial borrowing against an asset that has effectively become worthless. Consequently, the protocol would be confronted with a considerable amount of bad debt from the existing loans, while also continuing to issue loans against an asset that holds no value, thereby compounding the problem of bad debt even further.
## Impact
Protocol will take on a large amount of bad debt should WBTC bridge become compromised and WBTC depegs

## Recommendation
I suggest utilizing a double oracle configuration that combines Chainlink with another on-chain liquidity oracle, such as UniV3 TWAP. By doing so, you can enhance the reliability and security of your system. One important feature of this setup is to establish a threshold for the on-chain liquidity oracle's price. If it falls below a certain percentage (for example, 2%) compared to the Chainlink oracles, it is crucial to halt any borrowing activities promptly. This precautionary measure ensures that potential price manipulation is mitigated by the Chainlink oracle, while the liquidity oracle acts as a safeguard against the depegging of the asset.
