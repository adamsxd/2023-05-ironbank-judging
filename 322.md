# Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData Might Return Stale Results

## Summary
The protocol is using Chainlink's latestRoundData, but there is not enough validation being done to ensure that it is the most recent price, as only the price is being returned. This might cause stale prices to be used when users are borrowing, redeeming, or liquidating positions.
## Vulnerability Detail
See summary.
## Impact
The price oracles are used in crucial parts of the protocol such as borrowing, redeeming, and liquidations, it is crucial to use the most up to date prices, especially in a volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Along with the current `require(price > 0, "invalid price");`, consider using all of the parameters in `latestRoundData` to ensure freshness.
```solidity
(uint80 roundID ,int256 price,, uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base,quote);
require(price > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); 
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```
