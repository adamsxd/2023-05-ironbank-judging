# Protocol gets into state of DOS when access to Chainlink price oracle is blocked

## Summary

The IronBank protocol leans heavily on the Chainlink oracle to retrive asset prices. If the access to this oracle gets blocked the project gets into a state of DOS.

## Vulnerability Detail

NOTE: This is issue is not the same as the Chainlink oracle returning an incorrect/stale price. In that case the Chainlink oracle is still rechable. The issue described here addresses a situation where the Chainlink oracle is not reachable to retrieve a price at all.

When retrieving an asset price in the IronBank protocol the `getPriceFromChainlink()` function of `PriceOracle.sol` is called which internally calls the `latestRoundData()` function of the respective oracle price feed: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L67/

The implementation of `getPriceFromChainlink()` looks as follows:

```Solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```

In case Chainlink's multisigs suddenly blocks access to its price feeds the execution of `registry.latestRoundData(base, quote)` will revert.

In consequence all logic that depends on Chainlink oracle prices will get into a state of DOS (suppling collateral, borrowing assets against liquidity, liquidations, ...)

It is true that the IronBank protocol can upgrade its oracle through the `setPriceOracle` function in the `IronBank.sol` contract: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L705

But an upgrade would not be instant and would put the protocol into a state of DOS for a relevant time until an upgrade is done. As these upgrades are assumed to be protected with multisigs, gathering the necessary quorum (e.g. 4/7) can take several hours especially at night when incident response is usually delayed.

Under these circumstances users cannot supply, borrow or witdraw assets. Also liquidations cannot happen eventhough accounts may be up for liquidation during the downtime of the oracle to reduce risk for the protocol. 

## Impact

Due to the state of DOS users cannot supply, borrow or witdraw assets. Also liquidations cannot happen.

## Recommendation

In order to mitigate this issue the call of the `latestRoundData()` function should be wrapped into a try catch block and a fallback oracle can be used to provide valid prices until the issues with the chainlink oracle are resolve.
