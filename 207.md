# Uni v2 functions of Uniswap extension would not work on L2s

## Summary

Uni v2 functions of Uniswap extension would not work on L2s.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UniswapExtension.sol` extension is expected to work with Uniswap v2 and v3 AMM. While v3 instances exist on all expected chains (mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism), v2 is presented only on mainnet:
https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/factory

Since contracts still would be deployed with some appropriate addresses (zero addresses probably) - this would lead to DOS or unexpected behavior of mentioned functionality.

## Impact

Uni v2 functions of Uniswap extension would not work on L2s.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding checks for Uni v2 functions that the factory address is not zero and revert with the appropriate error in another case.
