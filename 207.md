# Functions associated with steth and wsteth would not work on L2s

## Summary

Functions associated with `steth` and `wsteth` would not work on L2s.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol uses addresses of `steth` and `wsteth` tokens hardcoded after deployment in its `PriceOracle.sol`, `UniswapExtension.sol`, `TxBuilderExtension.sol`. While `wsteth` token exist on all 3 expected chains (mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism), its functionality is different on L2s, particularity it does not have functions that oracle and other contracts expected to use, for example, `getWstETHByStETH`:
https://arbiscan.io/token/0x5979D7b546E38E414F7E9822514be443A4800529#code

At the same time, `steth` token is not presented on L2s at all.
Since contracts still would be deployed with some appropriate addresses (zero addresses probably) - this would lead to DOS or unexpected behavior of mentioned functionality.

## Impact

All functionality associated with steth and wsteth (oracle and extensions) would not work on L2s.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating functionality connected with steth and wseth for contracts that would be deployed on L2s.
