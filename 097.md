# A user can front-run becoming a credit account and take a unliquidateable loan.

## Summary
A user can front-run becoming a credit account and take a loan which can then not be liquidated as the user is a creditAccount. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose a user is about to become a credit account and be given a small credit limit on market A. User front-runs the `setCreditLimit` tx and takes a large borrow in market B against some collateral they have. Now that they are a credit account they cannot get liquidated for this large borrow. Furthermore, the user can even use his credit limit on market A and take even more unliquidateable borrow. 
The user can then treat the first borrow as an option - since he cannot get liquidated for it, he can wait as long as they want and at any time get whichever between the collateral and the borrow costs more. 
Combined with the fact that once users become credit accounts, they can no longer be non-credit accounts due to flaw in the logic (check my other issue) , I believe this should be of High Severity.  

## Impact
A user can take a large unliquidateable loan

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either change the CreditAccount status to be directly linked to a certain market, or do not allow users to become Credit accounts if they have outstanding debts.
