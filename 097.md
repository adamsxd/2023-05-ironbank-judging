# calculateLiquidationOpportunity returns false results

## Summary
`calculateLiquidationOpportunity` doesn't return correct values as it doesn't call `accrueInterest()` before calculating the liquidation opportunity. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When liquidating, interest is first accrued. 
```solidity
        _accrueInterest(marketBorrow, mBorrow);
        _accrueInterest(marketCollateral, mCollateral);
```
However, such thing isn't done in `calculateLiquidationOpportunity`
```solidity
function calculateLiquidationOpportunity(address marketBorrow, address marketCollateral, uint256 repayAmount)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        DataTypes.Market storage mCollateral = markets[marketCollateral];

        return _getLiquidationSeizeAmount(marketBorrow, marketCollateral, mCollateral, repayAmount);
    }
```
This would leave to wrong/ different results from the two.
Consider the following two scenarios:
1. Any project/ contract that is built on top of IronBank and first calls `calculateLiquidationOpportunity` and then `liquidate()` and verifies the two results will fail/ revert. 
2. If there is a market with low activity/ volume interest may not be accrued for a long time, a user might call `calculateLiquidationOpportunity` and based on the result decide to call liquidation. To his surprise, he may get different amount than the one expected. 


## Impact
Different results when liquidating than what was expected.
