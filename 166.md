# It will be close to impossible to liquidate the entirety of a loan

## Summary
When liquidating, the liquidator has to supply the `repayAmount` which may lead to some unexpected results. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that the liquidator has to supply the `repayAmount` and based off of it to calculate the `IBTokens` they should receive. 
This leads to problematic scenarios: 

For simplicity, lets consider both collateral and borrow tokens are of equal price.
User A is to be liquidated, having a loan of 1e18 and collateral of 1.1e18
`mCollateral.config.liquidationBonus = 12_000` (120%)
User B wants to liquidate user A and has enough tokens to liquidate the entirety of the loan. He passes `repayAmount = type(uint256).max` which repays the whole borrow. However, when calculating the `IBTokens` the liquidator has to receive in `_getLiquidationSeizeAmount()` it will be calculated in the following lines:
```solidity
        uint256 numerator = (mCollateral.config.liquidationBonus * borrowMarketPrice) / FACTOR_SCALE;
        uint256 denominator = (_getExchangeRate(mCollateral) * collateralMarketPrice) / 1e18;

        return (repayAmount * numerator) / denominator;
```
`(repayAmount * numerator) / denominator` will be equal to `repayAmount * mCollateral.config.liquidationBonus / FACTOR_SCALE = repayAmount * 1.2 = 1.2e18`

Then `_transferIBToken()` will be called with 1.2e18 as an argument. The borrower only has 1.1e18 and the tx will revert.
In order to get the entirety of 1.1e18 IBTokens, the user will have to make numerous calculations outside of IronBank, considering constantly changing variables such as token prices, `exchangeRate` and also the `liquidationBonus`.

This will be even more of a problem if the borrower has their collateral in multiple different markets. In order to get all of the collateral from each market, the liquidator will have to make even more calculations outside of the IronBank smart contracts, heavily discouraging liquidations. It can be expected that most liquidators will simply go with significantly lower `repayAmount` in order to be sure that the tx will not revert, leaving loans not fully liquidated.

## Impact
Liquidatable loans not fully liquidated. Attempts to fully liquidate a loan will often lead to revert

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of passing the `repayAmount` as an argument, pass the `IBTokenAmount` and based off of it calculate how much the liquidator must repay.
