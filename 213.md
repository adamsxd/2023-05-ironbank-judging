# FlashLoan.sol does not comply with EIP3156

## Summary

FlashLoan.sol does not comply with EIP3156.

## Vulnerability Detail

EIP3156 declares that the `FlashLoan` contract `MUST` returns 0 for the `maxFlashLoan` call and revert for `flashFee` call in case if requesting token is not currently supported:

```solidity
The maxFlashLoan function MUST return the maximum loan possible for token. If a token is not currently supported maxFlashLoan MUST return 0, instead of reverting.

The flashFee function MUST return the fee charged for a loan of amount token. If the token is not supported flashFee MUST revert.
```
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156

`FlashLoan.sol` in both functions checks that the market with requesting  token is currently listed in protocol and returns 0 or revert in other cases as EIP requires:
```solidity
File: FlashLoan.sol
28:     function maxFlashLoan(address token) external view override returns (uint256) { 
29:         if (!IronBankInterface(ironBank).isMarketListed(token)) {
30:             return 0;
31:         }


49:     function flashFee(address token, uint256 amount) external view override returns (uint256) {
...
52:         require(IronBankInterface(ironBank).isMarketListed(token), "token not listed");
```

In case the market is listed but currently paused - flashloan could not be executed for such tokens (which means they are not currently supported for floashloan) since it would be reverted during a call to `IronBank#borrow` function:
```solidity
File: IronBank.sol
351:     function borrow(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
...
355:     {
356:         DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
...
358:         require(!m.config.isBorrowPaused(), "borrow paused");
```

This means that in such cases `maxFlashLoan` and `flashFee` functions should return 0 and revert accordingly. However, due to a lack of checks that the market is paused, they would return values like for markets that are not paused. This breaks the requirements of  EIP3156. 

Worth mentioning, that it especially touches `pTokens`, since they can't be borrowed by protocol design - they also should be always considered as not supported for flashloan, while returns of `maxFlashLoan` and `flashFee` functions would declare the opposite.

## Impact

FlashLoan.sol does not comply with EIP3156 while it's explicitly declared that it should. It's returned wrong values for paused markets, that are not supported for flashloan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding checks to the `maxFlashLoan` and `flashFee` functions that the market with requesting token is not currently paused.
