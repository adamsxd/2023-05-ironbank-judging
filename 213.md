# Flashloan could be DOS for some tokens

## Summary

Flashloan could be DOS for some tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens (like USDT) have protection against race conditions, which do not allow changing allowance amounts in case the current value is not 0. Due to this `safeApprove` function in `SafeERC20` library would revert in such cases:
```solidity
File: SafeERC20.sol
45:     function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
46:         // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
47:         // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
48:         // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
49:         require(
50:             (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
51:             "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
52:         );
53:         _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
54:     }
55: 
```

At the same time `FlashLoan.sol` calls `safeApprove` if the current allowance is less than loaned amount:
```solidity
File: FlashLoan.sol
097:     function _loan(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, address token, uint256 amount, bytes memory data, address msgSender) 
098:         internal
099:     {
100:         IronBankInterface(ironBank).borrow(address(this), address(receiver), token, amount);
101: 
102:         require(receiver.onFlashLoan(msgSender, token, amount, 0, data) == CALLBACK_SUCCESS, "callback failed"); // no fee
103: 
104:         IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(address(receiver), address(this), amount);
105: 
106:         uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), ironBank);
107:         if (allowance < amount) {
108:             IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max); 
109:         }
110: 
111:         IronBankInterface(ironBank).repay(address(this), address(this), token, amount);
112:     }
```

This could leave to DOS of flashloan functionality at some point in time.

## Impact

Flashloan could be DOS for tokens that have protection against race conditions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider calling approve with 0 amount before calling approve with `type(uint256).max`.
