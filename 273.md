# XDZIBEC- Incorrect price calculation for stETH

## Summary

- The contract incorrectly calculates the price of `stETH` because it does not include the number of decimal places for the price. This could lead to users losing money if they rely on the contract to provide accurate price information

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 function getPrice(address asset) external view returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == wsteth) {
            uint256 stEthPrice = getPriceFromChainlink(steth, Denominations.USD);
            uint256 stEthPerToken = WstEthInterface(wsteth).stEthPerToken();
            uint256 wstEthPrice = (stEthPrice * stEthPerToken) / 1e18;
            return getNormalizedPrice(wstEthPrice, asset);
        }

        AggregatorInfo memory aggregatorInfo = aggregators[asset];
        uint256 price = getPriceFromChainlink(aggregatorInfo.base, aggregatorInfo.quote);
        if (aggregatorInfo.quote == Denominations.ETH) {
            // Convert the price to USD based if it's ETH based.
            uint256 ethUsdPrice = getPriceFromChainlink(Denominations.ETH, Denominations.USD);
            price = (price * ethUsdPrice) / 1e18;
        }
        return getNormalizedPrice(price, asset);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Get price from Chainlink.
     * @param base The base asset
     * @param quote The quote asset
     * @return The price
     */
```
- There is a vulnerability in the `getPrice()` function, the vulnerability occurs because the `getPriceFromChainlink` function is missing a `required` parameter, which is the number of decimal places for the price of `stETH`. Without this parameter, the contract will incorrectly calculate the price.

## Impact
- The vunerability can lead to  an inaccurate calculation of the price of `stETH`. This can lead to incorrect valuations, estimations, or decisions based on the price of `stETH`. If the price is used for important operations or financial calculations within the contract, it can have significant implications for the system's behavior and users this can lead to loss funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the correct line of code should include the missing parameter, which represents the number of decimal places for the price of `stETH`. as follow:
```solidity
uint256 stEthPrice = getPriceFromChainlink(steth, Denominations.USD, 18);
```
- This ensures that the `getPriceFromChainlink` function receives the correct arguments, including the decimal places for the price of `stETH`.
- The corrected version of the `getPrice` function also includes the necessary adjustment for the` stEthPrice` calculation based on the `stEthPerToken` value, as well as the conversion of `ETH-based` prices to `USD` based on the` ethUsdPrice` value
