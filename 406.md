# Lack of freshness check while retrieving price from oracle

## Summary
ChainlinkOracle should use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough to be used.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of price oracle is as follows

```solidity 
 function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }

```
Under cirucmstances like unforseen market event , volatile market conditions , degraded performance of infrastructure, chains, or networks, upstream data providers outage, malicious activities from third parties among others , there is a chance that data feed does not updates according to the latest price and might return `old/stale price` . 
Chainlink recommends using their data feeds along with some controls to prevent mismatches with the retrieved data. Along some recommendations, the feed can include circuit breakers (for extreme price events), contract update delays (to ensure that the injected data into the protocol is fresh enough), manual kill-switches (to cease connection in case of found bug or vulnerability in an upstream contract), monitoring (control the deviation of the data) and soak testing (of the price feeds).

The feed.lastRoundData() interface parameters [according to Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/docs/price-feeds-api-reference/) are the following:
```solidity 
function latestRoundData() external view
    returns (
        uint80 roundId,             //  The round ID.
        int256 answer,              //  The price.
        uint256 startedAt,          //  Timestamp of when the round started.
        uint256 updatedAt,          //  Timestamp of when the round was updated.
        uint80 answeredInRound      //  The round ID of the round in which the answer was computed.
    )
```
Because there is not check wether the timestamp of price updation is latest enough for it to be used in calculation , this can result in either underpricing or overpricing of assets . 

## Impact
Price Feed is used in manily by 3 functions 
1. `_getAccountLiquidity` - IronBank.sol
2. `_isLiquidatable`  - IronBank.sol
3. `_getLiquidationSiezeAmount` - IronBank.sol
4. `_getMarketStatus` - IronBankLens.sol

Miscalculation in these function will direclty affect all those functions which are accessing these in order to complete their execution , some of them are critical in nature like `borrow` , `liquidate` and `redeem`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Chainlink Recommends
>Your application should track the latestTimestamp variable or use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.
During periods of low volatility, the heartbeat triggers updates to the latest answer. Some heartbeats are configured to last several hours, so your application should check the timestamp and verify that the latest answer is recent enough for your application.

And they have this heartbeat concept:
>Chainlink Price Feeds do not provide streaming data. Rather, the aggregator updates its latestAnswer when the value deviates beyond a specified threshold or when the heartbeat idle time has passed. You can find the heartbeat and deviation values for each data feed at data.chain.link or in the Contract Addresses lists.

The Heartbeat on Arbitrum is usually 1h.

Consider adding the missing freshness check for stale price:
```solidity
 function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");
        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < validPeriod, "freshness check failed.") 

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```
The `validPeriod` can be based on the `Heartbeat` of the feed
