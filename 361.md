# supplyNativeToken will strand ETH in contract if called after ACTION_DEFER_LIQUIDITY_CHECK

## Summary

supplyNativeToken deposits msg.value to the WETH contract. This is very problematic if it is called after ACTION_DEFER_LIQUIDITY_CHECK. Since onDeferredLiqudityCheck creates a new context msg.value will be 0 and no ETH will actually be deposited for the user, causing funds to be stranded in the contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[TxBuilderExtension.sol#L252-L256](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L252-L256)

    function supplyNativeToken(address user) internal nonReentrant {
        WethInterface(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
        IERC20(weth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(ironBank), msg.value);
        ironBank.supply(address(this), user, weth, msg.value);
    }

supplyNativeToken uses the context sensitive msg.value to determine how much ETH to send to convert to WETH. After ACTION_DEFER_LIQUIDITY_CHECK is called, it enters a new context in which msg.value is always 0. We can outline the execution path to see where this happens:

`execute > executeInteral > deferLiquidityCheck > ironBank.deferLiquidityCheck > onDeferredLiquidityCheck (new context) > executeInternal > supplyNativeToken`

When IronBank makes it's callback to TxBuilderExtension it creates a new context. Since the ETH is not sent along to this new context, msg.value will always be 0. Which will result in no ETH being deposited and the sent either is left in the contract.

Although these funds can be recovered by the admin, it may can easily cause the user to be unfairly liquidated in the meantime since a (potentially significant) portion of there collateral hasn't been deposited. Additionally in conjunction with my other submission on ownable not being initialized correctly, the funds would be completely unrecoverable due to lack of owner.

## Impact

User funds are indefinitely (potentially permanently) stuck in the contract. Users may be unfairly liquidated due to their collateral not depositing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

msg.value should be cached at the beginning of the function to preserve it across contexts
