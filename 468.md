# No checks for whether Arbitrum sequencer is down

## Summary
There are no checks in the Oracle code that ensure that the Arbitrum sequencer is up.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol plans to deploy the application on L2s like Arbitrum. So, when utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. 

## Impact
If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow its users to keep using the stale rates.

## Code Snippet
The [`getPriceFromChainlink`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66) function:

```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(
        address base,
        address quote
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price, , , ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote); 
        require(price > 0, "invalid price"); 

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return
            uint256(price) *
            10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make use of a variable `timeSinceUp` and ensure that:

```solidity
uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
    revert GracePeriodNotOver();
}
```
