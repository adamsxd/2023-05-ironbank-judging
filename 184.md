# Malicious Borrowers can't be liquidated

Malicious Borrowers can't be liquidated 
## Summary
If a borrower can borrow amounts that would make their borrow balance from several markets to be rounded to zero in the getborrowerbalance function, the _isLiquidatable function will always return false making a borrower immune to liquidation.
## Vulnerability Detail
when the liquidation function is called it does a check to ensure the borrower is liquidatable, and to check this it calls the _isLquidatable function which returns true(if the borrower is liquidatedable) or false(if the borrower isn't liquidatable), However the _isLquidatable function goes through a loop to get the debtValue of a borrower in certain markets, by keeping track of all the `borrowersBalance with interest` in all those market, but to get the borrowersBalance of a user in a certain market it calls the _getborrowBalance function which is susceptible to potential rounding errors that may result in returning a value of 0, even if the actual borrow balance should be non-zero, Note the calculation in the _getBorrowBalance goes like this `borrowBalanceWithInterests = borrowBalance * marketBorrowIndex / userBorrowIndex` due to the nature of integer division in solidity, if the division results in a value less than 1, it will be rounded to zero, considering this issue a situation where the debtValue is gotten by the summation of all `(borrowBalance * assetPrice) / 1e18` of certain markets if the borrowBalance of the user in most or some of the markets is rounded down to zero, causing the return value of the _isLiquidatable function which is gotten by checking if the debtValue > liquidationCollateralValue to always be false since the debtValue would always be lower that the liquidationcolleteralvalue making the liquidate function to always revert on checkingg if the borrower is liquidatable.
**Proof of Concept**
```foundry
import "foundry.sol";

contract IronBank {
    struct Market {
        mapping(address => UserBorrow) userBorrows;
        uint256 borrowIndex;
    }
    
    struct UserBorrow {
        uint256 borrowBalance;
        uint256 borrowIndex;
    }
    
    function _getBorrowBalance(Market storage m, address user) internal view returns (uint256) {
        UserBorrow memory b = m.userBorrows[user];

        if (b.borrowBalance == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // borrowBalanceWithInterests = borrowBalance * marketBorrowIndex / userBorrowIndex
        return (b.borrowBalance * m.borrowIndex) / b.borrowIndex;
    }
    
    function testRoundingIssue() public view returns (bool) {
        Market storage market = ...;  // Initialize the market
        
        // Simulate a UserBorrow struct where borrowBalance is 1 and borrowIndex is 5
        UserBorrow memory userBorrow = UserBorrow(1, 5);
        market.userBorrows[msg.sender] = userBorrow;
        market.borrowIndex = 10;  // Set the market borrowIndex to 10
        
        // Call the _getBorrowBalance function
        uint256 result = _getBorrowBalance(market, msg.sender);
        
        // Check if the result is zero due to rounding
        return result == 0;
    }
}

contract IronBankTest {
    using Foundry for *;

    function testRoundingIssue() public {
        IronBank contractInstance = new IronBank();
        
        // Call the testRoundingIssue function
        contractInstance.testRoundingIssue().assertEqual(true);
    }
}
```
In this example, we have a simplified MyContract contract that contains the _getBorrowBalance function and a testRoundingIssue function to demonstrate the rounding issue.

The testRoundingIssue function sets up a mock scenario by initializing a Market struct and assigning a UserBorrow struct to the userBorrows mapping. In this case, the borrowBalance is set to 1, the borrowIndex of the user is set to 5, and the borrowIndex of the market is set to 10.

The function then calls the _getBorrowBalance function with the market and the sender's address as arguments. It checks if the returned result is zero, indicating the presence of a rounding issue.

Finally, the MyContractTest contract uses the foundry library to execute the test case. The testRoundingIssue function is called on the contractInstance, and the assertion checks if the result is equal to true, indicating the presence of the rounding issue.
## Impact
This could be exploited in a way where the borrower would borrow calculated amounts, that would make the return value of the getborrowbalace function to be rounded down to zero making such a borrower to be immune to liquidation, even tho the collateral price fall below the liquidationCollateralValue, causing loss of funds to ironBank & it's suppliers.
