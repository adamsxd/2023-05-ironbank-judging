# User can't redeem/repay funds after a market is delisted

## Summary
The protocol can decide to delist markets, there's a soft and hard delist. In the current implementation, when a market is delisted, there's no way to redeem or repay. A user should always be able to get his funds back.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within most functions, there's the following check: 
```solidity
require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
```
When a market is delisted a user won't be able to redeem or repay his funds due to that check.
## Impact
Users that borrowed assets for a certain market won't be able to redeem/repay after a market is delisted.

## Recommendation
Always let users redeem, even for delisted markets. Just prevent borrowing from the delisted market.
