# It is possible to set invalid aggregators

## Summary
The function used to set new aggregators implement some checks to ensure that the new added aggregators are working correctly but these checks can be bypassed in some cases.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_setAggregators` inside `PriceOracle.sol` is used to set new aggregator on the protocol. Some checks are done to ensure that the aggregators that are wanted to be added are correctly working. 
The problem is that if the `base` of the aggregator is equal to `address(0)` these safety checks are not performed and the aggregator is directly added.

```solidity
 if (aggrs[i].base != address(0)) {
```

```solidity
function _setAggregators(Aggregator[] calldata aggrs) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 length = aggrs.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length;) {
            if (aggrs[i].base != address(0)) {
                require(aggrs[i].quote == Denominations.ETH || aggrs[i].quote == Denominations.USD, "unsupported quote");

                // Make sure the aggregator works.
                address aggregator = address(registry.getFeed(aggrs[i].base, aggrs[i].quote));
                require(registry.isFeedEnabled(aggregator), "aggregator not enabled");

                (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(aggrs[i].base, aggrs[i].quote);
                require(price > 0, "invalid price");
            }
            aggregators[aggrs[i].asset] = AggregatorInfo({base: aggrs[i].base, quote: aggrs[i].quote});

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

Due to that, it is possible to add an aggregator that has a `.base` equals to `address(0)` but that is not working.

## Impact
Not working aggregator can be added to the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `if (aggrs[i].base != address(0)) {` check to ensure that every aggregator that is wanted to be added execute the 'safety checks'
