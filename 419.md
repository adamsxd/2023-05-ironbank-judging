# Anyone can defer liquidity for other users

## Summary
Any user is able to execute a defer liquidity transaction for other user that are is himself.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `IronBank.sol` contract implements a `deferLiquidityCheck` which is set as external, therefore anyone can call it, and has an `address user` parameter:

```solidity
 function deferLiquidityCheck(address user, bytes memory data) external {
        require(!isCreditAccount(user), "credit account cannot defer liquidity check");
        require(liquidityCheckStatus[user] == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_NORMAL, "reentry defer liquidity check");
        liquidityCheckStatus[user] = LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DEFERRED;

        DeferLiquidityCheckInterface(msg.sender).onDeferredLiquidityCheck(data);

        uint8 status = liquidityCheckStatus[user];
        liquidityCheckStatus[user] = LIQUIDITY_CHECK_NORMAL;

        if (status == LIQUIDITY_CHECK_DIRTY) {
            _checkAccountLiquidity(user);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
A contract that implements a `onDeferredLiquidityCheck(address user)` function is able to call the `deferLiquidityCheck` function in the `IronBank` contract and set `address user` as the address of other user so that the  liquidityCheckStatus[user] can suffer modifications when other users want.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a modifier that only allows the user himself, the contract IronBank or any other trusted contract to execute the `deferLiquidityCheck` function
