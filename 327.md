# MarketConfiguration: adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold() could lead to immediate liquidations of users

## Summary
Owners of Iron Bank have the ability to adjust the liquidation threshold of any market through the `adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold()`. If an owner lowers this threshold, users would be able to be immediately liquidated without any notice.  With MEV bots that specialize in liquidations, users will not even have a chance to add more collateral for their loan. 
## Vulnerability Detail
See summary. 
## Impact
Users could be immediately liquidated if owners change the liquidation threshold.

## Recommendation
Consider adding a timelock for functions such as `adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold()` that make major changes to the protocol to allow users ample time to react.
