# Liquidated collateral can get stuck in credit accounts

## Summary

When liquidating collateral via `IronBank#liquidate()`, the `liquidator` receives the liquidated `IBToken` amount. It is possible for the `liquidator` to be a credit account, and credit accounts are not properly equipped to handle `IBToken` transfers or redemption. So, the received `IBToken` amount may be stuck until such time as the credit account is able to pay down its debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `IronBank` designates "credit accounts" which exist outside of the typical supply/borrow/repay/redeem workflow. These accounts are uncollateralized, meaning they can borrow up to a given credit limit without supplying any collateral, and they are also immune to liquidation. They are trusted to repay their own debts over time.

Given the special treatment of these accounts, some important specializations are made across the `IronBank`:
- A credit account cannot be _supplied_ to, meaning it cannot mint `IBToken` collateral.
- A credit account does not have its `IBToken` collateral checked upon _borrowing_ because it does not need to collateralize loans.
- A credit account can only _borrow to_ and _repay for_ itself.
- A credit account cannot be _liquidated_.
- A credit account cannot _receive_ `IBToken` transfers executed via ERC20 methods (`IBToken#transfer()` and `IBToken#transferFrom()`).

However, there is no special treatment given to the following:
- A credit account attempting a _redemption_ will have its liquidity checked just like any other account (`collateral >= debt`).
- A credit account attempting to _send_ `IBToken` collateral will have its liquidity checked just like any other account.

There are no specializations made for sending or redeeming collateral tokens because credit accounts are not expected ever to hold `IBToken` collateral. They cannot mint it, and they cannot receive it via traditional transfers. However, there is one corner case in which they can receive it: **liquidations**.

When calling `IronBank#liquidate()`, the `borrower` is prohibited from being a credit account (because they cannot be liquidated), but the `liquidator` can be a credit account. This means that a credit account can receive `IBToken` collateral via liquidation even though it is never supposed to hold these tokens. This occurs via the call to `IronBank#_transferIBToken()`, which lacks the `isCreditAccount()` check from its external entrypoint, `IronBank#transferIBToken()`.

Once the credit account receives collateral, it may not be empowered to redeem that collateral. This is because:

1. Any attempt to call `IronBank#redeem()` will require an evaluation of the collateral/debt ratio via `_checkAccountLiquidity()`.
2. Any attempt to call `IBToken#transfer()` to move tokens to another address for redemption will also invoke `_checkAccountLiquidity()`.

This is problematic for credit accounts in particular because they are not supposed to maintain collateral for their borrow positions. As such, the credit account may very well have a large outstanding borrow, and it will never be able to redeem the liquidated collateral until it first pays its debt in full. The `IBToken` collateral is stuck for an unknown amount of time, which may be quite long depending on the conditions of the loan.

## Impact

`IBToken` collateral, received by the user as a reward for liquidating an at-risk account, can remain stuck indefinitely in a credit account. The user may never receive their reward for maintaining the system's integrity, or may receive it after an unknowably long time delay. This breaks the system's incentive model for liquidators.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either add the following line to `IronBank#liquidate()`:

```solidity
        require(!isCreditAccount(liquidator), "cannot liquidate to a credit account");
```

Or consider moving the external transfer restriction on L566 of `IronBank#transferIBToken()` to the internal transfer function, `IronBank#_transferIBToken()`, to account for all transfers including liquidations:
