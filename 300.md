# XDZIBEC-reduceReserves function does not validate the recipient parameter

## Summary
- The `reduceReserves` function in the `IronBankInterface` interface does not validate the recipient parameter. This means that an attacker could call the `reduceReserves` function and specify a `recipient` address that they control. This would allow the attacker to steal the `ibTokenAmount` from the `IronBank` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/* ========== RESERVE MANAGER INTERFACES ========== */

    function absorbToReserves(address market) external;

    function reduceReserves(address market, uint256 ibTokenAmount, address recipient) external;
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the  `IronBankInterface` interface, so the problem is in the` recipient `parameter. The `recipient` parameter is a destination address where the` ibTokenAmount` will be sent. However, the `recipient` parameter is not validated. This means that an attacker could call the `reduceReserves` function and specify a `recipient` address that they control. This would allow the attacker to `steal` the `ibTokenAmount` from the `IronBank` contract.
## Impact
- The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to steal `ibTokens` from the `IronBank` contract.
- The vulnerability  could have a significant financial  on the `IronBank` contract and its `users`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Validate the `recipient` parameter before sending the `ibTokenAmount`.
- The `recipient` parameter is not used in the `reduceReserves` function, so it is not needed. Removing the `recipient` parameter will make the `reduceReserves` function more secure and less likely to be exploited by an attacker.
