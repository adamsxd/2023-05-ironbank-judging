# XDZIBEC-wrap function does not validate the amount parameteR

## Summary
- The `wrap` function in the `PTokenInterface` interface does not validate the `amount` parameter,it's means that an attacker could call the `wrap` function and specify an `amount` that is `greater` than the `amount` of underlying `tokens` that the attacker has. This would allow the attacker to `mint` new `PTokens` without having the underlying `tokens` to back them up.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
interface PTokenInterface is IERC20 {
    function getUnderlying() external view returns (address);

    function wrap(uint256 amount) external;

    function unwrap(uint256 amount) external;

    function absorb(address user) external;
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the  `PTokenInterface` interface, so the problem is in the `amount` parameter. The amount parameter is the `amount` of underlying `tokens` that will be `wrapped` the `amount` parameter is not validated. This means that an attacker could call the `wrap` function and specify an `amount` that is greater than the `amount` of underlying `tokens` that the attacker has. 
the `wrap` function is responsible for `wrapping` underlying `tokens` into `PTokens`. 
## Impact
- An attacker could exploit the vulnerability and  `mint` a large number of `PTokens` without having the underlying tokens to back them up.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Validate the `amount` parameter before minting new `PTokens`. this prevents an attacker from minting new `PTokens` without having the underlying `tokens` to back them up.
