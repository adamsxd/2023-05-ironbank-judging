# User can get liquidated even if collateral is sufficient by using ibToken at an other protocol

## Summary
In DeFi, it's normal that for example the LP tokens (or in this case the ibTokens) are used for an other protocol as e.g. collateral.
This would mean that the user sends their ibTokens to an other address, deducting the value from their account. 
This is due to the fact that `IronBank._isLiquidatable` uses ibTokens to calculate `liquidationCollateralValue` instead of the ERC20 amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine the following scenario's:
1. the user supplys all of their `supplyBalance` to an other protocol
This wil lead the function to skip `liquidationCollateralValue`

while debt still being calculated and added to `debltValue`

2. the user supply only an x % of their `supplyBalance`
This will lead to an incorrect calculation of  `liquidationCollateralValue`

## Impact
Users being liquidated while having sufficient collateral.

## Recommendation
Consider calculation collateral based on ERC20 supply value.

Since, looking at other protocols, there's a high possibility that ibTokens can be used for other protocols, setting it at high instead of med
