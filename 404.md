# CreditLimit cannot be set to zero.

## Summary
Functions with gas consumption exceeding the block's gas limit will not be able to complete.
The `deleteElement` function in the Arrays library loops through the number of elements in the largest case, but this may exceed the gas limit, in which case the function reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In IronBank's `setCreditLimit`, when an authorized person tries to set `credit == 0`, it tries to do `allCreditMarkets[user].deleteElement(market);`. If the computation of `deleteElement` is too large, it will not be able to set the credit to zero.
## Impact
If not set to zero, credit may be used fraudulently
