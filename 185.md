# No liveness check for chainlink feed prices

## Summary

PriceOracle should use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough to be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

PriceOracle contract does not make a liveness check using the updatedAt value returned by the latestRoundData() call which can lead to stale prices being used across the app in the event of large price movements in a short duration of time.

The chainlink team also recommends adding custom liveness checks depending on the application use case. 

## Impact

Since the PriceOracle is used to deem a persons position to be healthy or not stale prices can cause unwanted liquidations and in some cases they can also overvalue an asset leading to bad debt.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding liveness check which is custom for each feed, this way the team can customize the check based on asset type and volatility.
