# Reentrancy Vulnerability in FlashLoan Contract

## Summary

The `_loan` method in the FlashLoan contract has a potential reentrancy vulnerability because it does not include a reentrancy guard. The function interacts with a potentially malicious contract that could manipulate state variables.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_loan` method, there is an external call to `receiver.onFlashLoan`. This function is potentially malicious and can be used for reentrancy attacks by calling back into the contract before the original function call is completed. This can lead to an unexpected state change and loss of funds.

This potential vulnerability exists even though the use of Solidity 0.8.0 and its built-in checks make reentrancy attacks less common. The presence of this external call and the subsequent state assumption indicate that this potential vulnerability needs addressing.

## Impact

Reentrancy attacks can lead to loss of funds or unexpected changes in the state of the contract. In this case, if a reentrancy attack were successful, it could potentially allow an attacker to drain funds from the Iron Bank.

## Code Snippet

The issue can be found in the `FlashLoan.sol` file:

```solidity
function _loan(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, address token, uint256 amount, bytes memory data, address msgSender)
    internal
{
    IronBankInterface(ironBank).borrow(address(this), address(receiver), token, amount);

    require(receiver.onFlashLoan(msgSender, token, amount, 0, data) == CALLBACK_SUCCESS, "callback failed"); // no fee

    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(address(receiver), address(this), amount);

    uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), ironBank);
    if (allowance < amount) {
        IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
    }

    IronBankInterface(ironBank).repay(address(this), address(this), token, amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's advisable to add a reentrancy guard that will prevent reentrant calls into the contract. This can be accomplished using a state variable that checks whether the contract is currently executing an external call and disallows any new calls until the first one is completed.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. A malicious contract calls `flashLoan` function of `FlashLoan` contract.
2. The `flashLoan` function defers the liquidity check and calls `_loan`.
3. Inside the `_loan` function, `IronBankInterface(ironBank).borrow` is called.
4. After borrowing, the `onFlashLoan` function of the malicious contract is called.
5. Inside the malicious contract's `onFlashLoan`, the contract makes a call back into the FlashLoan contract, exploiting the lack of reentrancy protection.
