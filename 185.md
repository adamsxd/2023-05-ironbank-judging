# Chainlink registry not available on arbitrum & optimism

## Summary

The price oracle of the protocol relies on using the chainlink registry to fetch asset prices. According to chainlink docs the registry is currently only available on mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail

The price oracle contract will not be able to register any feeds on arbitrum or optimism due to unavailability of a chainlink registry on both the chains.

## Impact

Due to a lack of a registry from chainlink on arbitrum and optimism the price oracle contract will render itself useless as it won't be able to register any new feeds and hence not return price for any assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider creating oracles specific for L2s that use chainlink feeds for two reasons:
- Missing an official chainlink registry
- L2 sequencer checks need to be added
