# PriceOracle needs to check for sequencer availability

## Summary
Using Chainlink's Arbitrum price feeds you should always check for sequencer availability
## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink Documentation recomends checking sequencer availability in order to prevent stale prices being used on L2:
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds
## Impact
If the sequencer has not been available and the price is not updated, this can result in undercollateralised positions or mistakenly liquidated ones, both causing a loss to either the protocol or the users.
