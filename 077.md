# `Reentrancyguard` would not work as intended

## Summary
Using openzepplin `reentrancyguard` for contracts deployed behind a proxy won't work.

## Vulnerability Detail
`reentrancyGuard`from openzepplin has the `_status` set in the [constructor](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L40), the `nonReentrant` modifier would not work as expect since `_status` variable is not reachable from the proxy.

## Impact
Leaving contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` and call `__ReentrancyGuard_init()` within the `initialize` function
