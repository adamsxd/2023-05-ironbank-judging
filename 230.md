# XDZIBEC- Deposit function and withdraw function does not specify maximum amount of ether that can be deposited and withdraw

## Summary
- The` deposit()` function does not specify a maximum amount of ether that can be `deposited`. This means that a malicious user could call the `deposit()` function with an arbitrary amount of ether, and the function would accept the ether. This could lead to a denial-of-service attack, where the malicious user could flood the contract with ether and prevent other users from depositing or withdrawing ether.
- and the vulnerability in the` withdraw()` function it does not specify the amount of ether that can be withdrawn. This means that a malicious user could call the withdraw function with an arbitrary amount of ether, and the function would withdraw the ether. This could lead to a loss of funds for the user who called the `withdraw()` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
  ```solidity
  interface IWETH9 is IERC20 {
    /// @notice Deposit ether to get wrapped ether
    function deposit() external payable;

    /// @notice Withdraw wrapped ether to get ether
    function withdraw(uint256) external;
}
```
-There is a vulnerability in the `deposit()` function does not specify the amount of ether that can be deposited. This means that a malicious user could call the deposit function with an arbitrary amount of ether, and the function would accept the ether.
-and there is another vulnerability in this code is in the `withdraw()` function does not specify the amount of ether that can be withdrawn.
## Impact
- The vulnerability exploited by a malicious from attackers can lead  to withdraw more ether than they are entitled to.
- The vulnerabilitie can lead to a loss of funds for the user who called the withdraw function.
- the `deposit()` function could be exploited by an attacker as follows:
    -  A malicious user could create a contract that calls the `deposit()` function with an arbitrary `amount` of ether.
    - The `deposit` function would accept the ether and store it in the contract.
    - The malicious user could then use the ether to perform malicious actions, such as flooding the network with transactions or launching a denial-of-service attack.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `deposit()` function should specify the maximum amount of ether that can be deposited. an example how to fix the bug:
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount) external payable {
    require(amount <= MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT, "amount must be <= MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT");
    // ...
}
```
- this is specifies the maximum amount of ether that can be deposited, and ensures that the amount of ether deposited does not exceed the maximum amount.
- To fix this bug in the withdraw() function should specify the maximum amount of ether that can be withdrawn. an example how to fix the bug:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(amount <= MAX_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT, "amount must be <= MAX_WITHDRAW_AMOUNT");
    // ...
}
```
- This is specifies the maximum amount of ether that can be withdrawn, and ensures that the amount of ether withdrawn does not exceed the maximum amount.
