# Doesn’t handle min / max price from chainlink

## Summary

`getPriceFromChainlink()` does not properly handle instances when price of the underlying / borrow asset is below the minimum configured price or above the maximum configured price on chainlink.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the price of the asset were to go out of range, chainlink will report the min / max values configured. This is not indicative of the real market price and can leave IronBank with a lot of bad debt. This is similar to how [venus lost 11m as a result of luna’s crash](https://medium.com/quillhash/venus-protocol-loses-11m-due-to-chainlink-%EF%B8%8F-f6cd2728e8cf). For example, you can check the min and max values of the STETH/ETH aggregator [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x716BB759A5f6faCdfF91F0AfB613133d510e1573#readContract).

## Impact
If the price of the underlying asset reported by chainlink is the minimum price configured but the real price is much lower, a user is able to buy more asset, supply it and borrow other assets. This will leave IronBank with a lot of bad debt.

## Recommendation
The chainlink documentation [offers a few suggestions](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits) on how to handle this edge case properly.
