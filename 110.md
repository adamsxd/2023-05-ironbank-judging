# Flashloan end result isn't controlled

## Summary
FlashLoan logic do not control the end result of transferring tokens out and back in. Given that protocol aims to support arbitrary non-rebasing (except stETH wrapping helper) / without fee on transfer / decimals in [1, 18] tokens, this includes any exotic types of behavior, for example, reporting a successful transfer, but not performing internal accounting update for any reason.

Here is the link of a same issue that was submitted on @sherlock https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-ajna-judging/issues/101

## Vulnerability Detail
Now there is no control of the resulting balance, and any token that successfully performs safeTransfer, but for any reason withholds an update of token internal accounting, can successfully steal the whole pool's balance of any Ajna pool. This can be initiated by an attacker unrelated to token itself as griefing.

As many core token contracts are upgradable (USDC, USDT and so forth), such behaviour can be not in place right now, but can be introduced in the future.

## Impact
Some tokens that qualify for Iron bank (including not imposing any fee on transfers) may not return the whole amount back, but will report successful safeTransfer(), i.e. up to the whole balance of Iron bank for such ERC20 token can be stolen.

This can take place in a situation when a popular token was upgraded and the consequences of the internal logic change weren't fully understood by wide market initially and most depositors remained in the corresponding Iron bank, then someone calls a flash loan as a griefing attack that will result in the token freezing the balancer of the protocol. Or it was understood, but the griefer was quicker.

As the probability of such internal mechanics introduction is low, but the impact is up to full loss of user's funds, setting the severity to be medium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a balance control check to ensure that flash loan invariant remains: record contract balance before.
