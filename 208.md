# Market with ERC20 tokens without decimals could not be listed

## Summary

Market with ERC20 tokens without decimals could not be listed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol expecting to work with any simple ERC20 tokens. EIP20 declares `decimals()` function as an `OPTIONAL` and that external contracts `MUST NOT` expect these values to be present:
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20

At the same time `MarketConfigurator.sol` would revert if the market with a token that does not have the `decimals()` function would be listed:

```solidity
File: MarketConfigurator.sol
468:     function _listMarket(
469:         address market,
470:         address ibTokenAddress,
471:         address debtTokenAddress,
472:         address interestRateModelAddress,
473:         uint16 reserveFactor,
474:         bool isPToken
475:     ) internal {
...
481:         uint8 underlyingDecimals = IERC20Metadata(market).decimals();
482:         require(underlyingDecimals <= 18, "nonstandard token decimals");
```


## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding checks that the token has decimals, setting market decimals to 0 otherwise, instead of reverting.
