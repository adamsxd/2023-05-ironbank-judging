# The redeem function is disabled.

## Summary
Functions with gas consumption exceeding the block's gas limit will not be able to complete; since the `redeem` function contains an unlimited number of loops inside, once the gas limit is reached, the redeem function cannot be used any more.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_getAccountLiquidity` function, loop through `allEnteredMarkets[user].length`. If this exceeds the gas limit of the block, the `redeem` function that internally calls `_getAccountLiquidity` cannot be invoked.
## Impact
Users will not be able to withdraw funds.
