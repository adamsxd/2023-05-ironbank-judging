# Protocol contracts use floating pragma, instead they should be locked to a specific version of compiler

## Summary
All protocol contracts uses floating version like pragma solidity ^0.8.0. This exposes to potential bugs that might effect the contract negatively. Floating pragma can be used for contracts that are intended to be used by other developers, but specific protocol contracts should always lock to a specific version of compiler in the test environment and conduct testing with the compiler and target the same compiler on deployment. It is a known issue and listed in swcregistry.

Instead, they should be locked to specific version of compiler like below as example.
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

## Vulnerability Detail
With floating pragma, the dev team will loose control of how the contract wil behave over its lifetime. Locking it to a specific version ensure the behaviour is tested first hand and that behaviour should remain.

## Impact
[CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/664.html)

## Code Snippet
The below is an example reference, this pragma is observed across all contract files in the protocol.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Update all the core contracts to specific version of the complier.
As example, something like below.
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

2) Perform thorough testing of the suite to ensure the protocol behaviour is validated for all scenarios.
