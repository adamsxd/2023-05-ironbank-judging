# `WBTC/USD` feed in Chainlink is not available and `BTC/USD` feed used for `WBTC` can be dangerous

## Summary
Every market in `IronBank` contract requires to have aggregator data in `PriceOracle`, which is used to fetch the current price of the specific market and used extensively throughout `IronBank` contract. Still, in Chainlink there is no feed for `WBTC/USD` and `BTC/USD` feed used for `WBTC` can be dangerous.

## Vulnerability Detail
`WBTC` is one of the tokens that will be one of the markets, but there is no `WBTC/USD` feed in Chainlink. 

If `BTC/USD` is meant to be used for `WBTC` price, then it can be dangerous because historically there have been instances where `WBTC` depegs from `BTC` which means that `WBTC price !== BTC price`. This means that if `BTC/USD` feed is used for `WBTC` and it depegs from `BTC`, the price difference can be exploited by a malicious user.

## Impact
Since there is no `WBTC/USD` feed on Chainlink and `WBTC` had depeged from `BTC` price historically, the price difference could calculate the incorrect collateral value, and borrow value and the protocol may be exploited by malicious users.

## Code Snippet
Price is fetched via `PriceOracle.getPrice` function

This function is used across `IronBank` contract (to calculate account liquidity)
