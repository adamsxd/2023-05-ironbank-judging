# Wrong Storage Slot Calculation

## Summary
There is a wrong storage slot calculation which could impact some major parts of the project if optimizations are made based on this.
in ```DataTypes.sol``` , there is the MarketConfig Struct which has this bug

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   struct MarketConfig {
        // 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11
        bool isListed;
        uint8 pauseFlags;
        uint16 collateralFactor;
        uint16 liquidationThreshold;
        uint16 liquidationBonus;
        uint16 reserveFactor;
        bool isPToken;
        //@audit-issue wrong storage slot calculation
        // 20 + 20 + 20 + 32 + 32 + 32
        address ibTokenAddress;
        address debtTokenAddress;
        address pTokenAddress;
        address interestRateModelAddress;
        uint256 supplyCap;
        uint256 borrowCap;
        uint256 initialExchangeRate;
    }
```
Here we can see the issue where the second calculation is made, we have 4 addresses which consume 20 bytes each and 3 uint256 values which contain 32 bytes each. But in the calculation, only 3 addresses were added.

## Impact
This could lead to overwriting of values in the same storage slot if assembly is used.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Storage slots calculations should be verified
