# XDZIBEC-Unchecked feeBips Parameter in IPeripheryPaymentsWithFee Interface

## Summary
The `feeBips` parameter in the `IPeripheryPaymentsWithFee` interface is not checked to make sure that it is in the range of 0 to 1. This means that an attacker could specify a negative or greater than `1 feeBips `value, which would cause the function to behave unexpectedly, an attacker could specify a negative `feeBips` value, which would cause the function to `send` all of the `transaction's Ether` to the `feeRecipient`.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
interface IPeripheryPaymentsWithFee is IPeripheryPayments {
    /// @notice Unwraps the contract's WETH9 balance and sends it to recipient as ETH, with a percentage between
    /// 0 (exclusive), and 1 (inclusive) going to feeRecipient
    /// @dev The amountMinimum parameter prevents malicious contracts from stealing WETH9 from users.
    function unwrapWETH9WithFee(
        uint256 amountMinimum,
        address recipient,
        uint256 feeBips,
        address feeRecipient
    ) external payable;

    /// @notice Transfers the full amount of a token held by this contract to recipient, with a percentage between
    /// 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive) going to feeRecipient
    /// @dev The amountMinimum parameter prevents malicious contracts from stealing the token from users
    function sweepTokenWithFee(
        address token,
        uint256 amountMinimum,
        address recipient,
        uint256 feeBips,
        address feeRecipient
    ) external payable;
}
```
the vulnerability  is in the `IPeripheryPaymentsWithFee` interface, the `unwrapWETH9WithFee()` and `sweepTokenWithFee()` functions both have a `feeBips` parameter, which specifies the percentage of the `transaction` that will be sent to the `feeRecipient`, the `feeBips` parameter is not checked to make sure that it is in the range of `0 to 1`. This means that an attacker could specify a negative or greater than `1 feeBips` value, which would cause the function to behave unexpectedly.
## Impact
 an attacker use the function to behave unexpectedly. For example, an attacker could specify a negative `feeBips` value, which would cause the function to send all of the` transaction's` Ether to the `feeRecipient` that lead to stealing funds from users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `feeBips` parameter could be checked to make sure that it is in the range of 0 to 1.
- The `feeRecipient` could be restricted to a trusted address.
