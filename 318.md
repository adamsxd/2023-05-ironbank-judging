# Wrong borrow rate is returned on using getBorrowRate()

## Summary
Wrong borrow rate is returned on using getBorrowRate() 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function getBorrowRate() is performing wrong calculation at line 57-58.
```solidity
return baseBorrowPerSecond + (kink1 * borrowPerSecond1) / 1e18
                + ((utilization - kink1) * borrowPerSecond2) / 1e18;
```

As per the comment on line 56, the following calculation should be performed:
```solidity
// base + kink1 * slope1 + (utilization - kink2) * slope2
```

However, at line 58, this is wrongly calculated as `(utilization - kink1)`, instead of `(utilization - kink2)` 

## Impact
Wrong borrow rate is being calculated/returned. This would in turn impact `_accrueInterest()` and a wrong value for `borrowRatePerSecond` will be fetched and used.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/interest-rate-model/TripleSlopeRateModel.sol#L56-L58

```solidity
            // base + kink1 * slope1 + (utilization - kink2) * slope2
            return baseBorrowPerSecond + (kink1 * borrowPerSecond1) / 1e18
                + ((utilization - kink1) * borrowPerSecond2) / 1e18;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The code should be corrected as follows:
```solidity
            // base + kink1 * slope1 + (utilization - kink2) * slope2
            return baseBorrowPerSecond + (kink1 * borrowPerSecond1) / 1e18
                + ((utilization - kink2) * borrowPerSecond2) / 1e18;
```
