# Cannot delete Extension that user has allowed

## Summary
Functions with gas consumption exceeding the block's gas limit will not be able to complete.
The `deleteElement` function in the Arrays library loops through the number of elements in the largest case, but this may exceed the gas limit, in which case the function reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
IronBank's `setUserExtension` function uses the `deleteElement` function when revoking permissions. If this process exceeds the gas limit, the permission cannot be revoked.
## Impact
Permission cannot be revoked, so there is a possibility of misuse of the permission against the user's will
