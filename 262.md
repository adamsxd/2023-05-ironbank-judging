# Chainlink price feed data not validated properly

## Summary

Chainlink price feed data not validated properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `PriceOracle.sol:getPriceFromChainlink()` the data returned by `registry.latestRoundData()` lacks validations for stale price and incomplete round.

In Chainlink's documentation we can find the following information:

> Your application should track the latestTimestamp variable or use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.
[[source](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/#check-the-timestamp-of-the-latest-answer)]

> If answeredInRound is less than roundId, the answer is being carried over. If answeredInRound is equal to roundId, then the answer is fresh.
[[source](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values)]

## Impact

The oracle can return stale prices, which may result in undercollateralised loans being taken or positions being liquidated even though they are not undercollateralised.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

```solidity
(uint80 roundId, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
require(timestamp > block.timestamp - MAX_DELAY, "Outdated price");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Outdated price");
```
