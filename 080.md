# No checks if Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, to check whether the Arbitrum Sequencer is active
## Vulnerability Detail
When using Chainlink on second-layer chains such as Arbitrum, it is required to ensure that the sequencer is up to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.

## Impact
Stale prices, e.g. if USDC were to de-peg while the sequencer is offline, stale price is used and can result in false liquidation or over-borrowing.

## Code Snippet
Chainlink oracles are used for some prices, but there are no sequencer oracles in use:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66
```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not.
