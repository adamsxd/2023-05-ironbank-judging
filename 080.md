# Credit account cannot redeem liquidate rewards after credit borrowing.

## Summary
Credit account cannot redeem liquidate rewards after credit borrowing.
This affects the normal function of the credit account. If you want to obtain liquidate rewards, you must first give up using credit.
## Vulnerability Detail
Liquidate does not restrict the participation of credit accounts, so credit accounts should be entitled to normal liquidation rewards.

The final result of liquidation is to increase the liquidator's supply through `_transferIBToken`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L877-L882
```solidity
        unchecked {
            m.userSupplies[from] = fromBalance - amount;
            // Overflow not possible: the sum of all balances is capped by totalSupply, and the sum is preserved by
            // decrementing then incrementing.
            m.userSupplies[to] += amount;
        }
```

If the liquidator wants to obtain actual reward tokens, they need to acquire them through `redeem`.
However, in `redeem`, it is necessary to check the liquidity of the account.

```solidity
        // Update storage.
        unchecked {
            m.userSupplies[from] = userSupply - ibTokenAmount;
            m.totalCash = totalCash - amount;
            // Underflow not possible: ibTokenAmount <= userSupply <= totalSupply.
            m.totalSupply -= ibTokenAmount;
        }

        // Check if need to exit the market.
        if (isRedeemFull && _getBorrowBalance(m, from) == 0) {
            _exitMarket(market, from);
        }

        IBTokenInterface(m.config.ibTokenAddress).burn(from, ibTokenAmount); // Only emits Transfer event.
        IERC20(market).safeTransfer(to, amount);

        _checkAccountLiquidity(from);
```

But for a credit account, borrowing does not require checking liquidity, that is, you can borrow without supplying.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L389-L394
```solidity
        if (isCreditAccount(from)) {
            require(from == to, "credit account can only borrow to itself");
            require(creditLimits[from][market] >= newUserBorrowBalance, "insufficient credit limit");
        } else {
            _checkAccountLiquidity(from);
        }
```

This leads to the following scenario:
1. Credit account borrow normally without supply.
2. Credit account liquidate other accounts.
3. When a credit account wants to withdraw the liquidation reward, it cannot pass the liquidity check in redeem because there is no supply left in the credit account at the end of redeem, combined with its previous borrow balance.

## Impact
Credit account cannot redeem liquidate rewards after credit borrowing.
This affects the normal function of the credit account. If you want to obtain liquidate rewards, you must first give up using credit.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the `from` in redeem is a credit account, skip the liquidity check because credit accounts can only obtain supply during liquidation.
