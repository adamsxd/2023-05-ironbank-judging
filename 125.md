# XDZIBEC -Vulnerability in createPool function does not check for attacker-created pools.

## Summary

the `createPool()` function in the `Uniswap V3` factory does not check to see if the `pool` was created by a legitimate `user` or by an `attacker`, this means that an attacker could create a contract that always `fails` the require statement in the `createPool()` function, this would prevent anyone from creating a `pool` for the specified `tokens` and `fee`, even if the user is legitimate.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function createPool(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint24 fee
    ) external override noDelegateCall returns (address pool) {
        require(tokenA != tokenB);
        (address token0, address token1) = tokenA < tokenB ? (tokenA, tokenB) : (tokenB, tokenA);
        require(token0 != address(0));
        int24 tickSpacing = feeAmountTickSpacing[fee];
        require(tickSpacing != 0);
        require(getPool[token0][token1][fee] == address(0));
        pool = deploy(address(this), token0, token1, fee, tickSpacing);
        getPool[token0][token1][fee] = pool;
        // populate mapping in the reverse direction, deliberate choice to avoid the cost of comparing addresses
        getPool[token1][token0][fee] = pool;
        emit PoolCreated(token0, token1, fee, tickSpacing, pool);
    }

```
- The `Uniswap V3 factory` contract has a vulnerability in the `createPool()` function, the vulnerability is specific  in the line `require(getPool[token0][token1][fee] == address(0));`, this line requires that the `pool` does not already exist for the specified `tokens` and` fee`, this is not always the case, if another contract has already created a `pool` for the specified `tokens` and `fee`, then the
`require` statement will `fail`, which will prevent the `createPool()` function from executing.

## Impact

An attacker could create a legitimate `pool`. For example, an attacker could create a contract that always fails the require statement in the `createPool()` function. This would prevent anyone from creating a pool for the specified tokens and fee,and leading to steal tokens from the users account

- The vulnerability could be exploited:
    - An attacker creates a contract that always fails the require statement in the createPool() function.
    - The attacker `deploys` this contract to the` blockchain`.
    -  A user tries to create a `pool` for the specified `tokens` and `fee`.
    - The `createPool()` function in the `Uniswap V3 factory` will `fail` because the attacker's contract will always `fail` the `require` statement.
    -  The `user` will not be able to create the `pool`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

for fixing this vulnerability, it's should change the line `require(getPool[token0][token1][fee] == address(0))`; to 
`require(!getPool[token0][token1][fee].exists());`. This will change the requirement from "`the pool does not already exist`" to 
"`the pool does not already exist and is not a contract`". This will allow the function to execute even if another contract has already created a `pool` for the specified `tokens` and `fee`.
