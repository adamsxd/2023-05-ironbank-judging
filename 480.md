# oracle has no check if the sequencer is alive

## Summary
Chainlink recommends that all L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle.
## Vulnerability Detail
Since this protocol will be deployed to Arbitrum this check should happen.

If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.
## Impact
If the Arbitrum sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates.

## Recommendation
