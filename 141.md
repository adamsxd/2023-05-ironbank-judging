# Malitious contracts can call directly the UniswapExtension.uniswapV3SwapCallback() & UniswapExtension.uniswapV2Call(), and gain control of the interactions between the UniswapExtension and the IronBank contracts

## Summary
- An Attacker can compute what the UniswapExtension contract will consider as a valid UniswapV3/V2 Pool [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/libraries/UniswapV3Utils.sol#L30-L46) & [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/libraries/UniswapV2Utils.sol#L14-L30), and deploy a malicious contract in that exact address, which will allow the attacker to bypass the check to ensure that only UniswapV3/V2 pools can call the  [uniswapV3SwapCallback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/UniswapExtension.sol#L237-L320) & [uniswapV2Call()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/UniswapExtension.sol#L333-L424) functions
  - The attacker will be able to call directly the uniswapV3SwapCallback() & uniswapV2Call() functions which will give him control of the interactions between the UniswapExtension & IronBank contracts, which could lead to any of the mentioned scenarios described on the Impact section


## Vulnerability Detail
- The mechanism in the uniswapV3SwapCallback() to validate if the calling pool is a valid uniswap pool is by calling the [getUniV3Pool() and passing three parameters that were received encoded in the `_data` parameter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/UniswapExtension.sol#L797-L800)
  - Then the getUniV3Pool() gets the poolKey by calling [UniswapV3Utils.getPoolKey()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/libraries/UniswapV3Utils.sol#L20-L23), and finally the [pool adddress is calculated by calling UniswapV3Utils.computeAddress() and passing two parameters: uniV3Factory & poolKey](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/libraries/UniswapV3Utils.sol#L30-L46).
    - The UniswapV3Utils.computeAddress() simply hashes the received parameters, encode them, hash them again, cast them onto an address data type, and finally returns the computed value as the poolAddress

- The EVM is a deterministic machine, meaning, the same set of inputs will produce the same output,  this means, that an attacker can calculate in advance the address of a pool that will be computed by the previously explained process and use that address to deploy a malicious contract on that exact address.
  - [For UniswapV3 pools](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/libraries/UniswapV3Utils.sol#L30-L46), the computed pool uses the `fee` as a parameter to compute the address of the pool, the range of addresses that could be computed is tremendously high, meaning, there is a lot of room to create fake contracts that address will end up being computed as if it were a valid UniswapV3
  - [For UniswapV2 pools](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/libraries/UniswapV2Utils.sol#L14-L30), is almost identical to the process of computing UniswapV3 pools, with the slight difference that for UniV2 pools there is no such a concept of fee, nevertheless, the attacker can compute the address in advance for a combination of a `<FakeToken>/<ValidTokenByIronBank>` and vice versa, in the end, when the UniswapExtension interacts with the IronBank contract it only uses one of the two tokens for the interactions.

- The attacker can simply make calls directly to the uniswapV3SwapCallback() & uniswapV2Call() from the fake contract that was deployed on an address that will be computed as a valid UniswapV3/V2 pool & force the UniswapExtension contract to interact with the IronBank.
  - The attacker can take loans using the UniswapExtenstion as the borrower and receive all the tokens on accounts of its own.
  - When the UniswapExtension has any balance of valid ERC20s on the IronBank, the attacker can use that balance to supply liquidity, and/or repay debts of its own on the IronBank without needing to use any of its own tokens, but using the tokens held on the UniswapExtension.

- It might be possible that there could be more side effects/consequences of an attacker being able to call uniswapV3SwapCallback() & uniswapV2Call() from malicious contracts, but a couple of issues mentioned in the description were the ones I was able to come up with during the timeline of the audit contest


## Impact
- The attacker can take loans (call IronBank.borrow()) using the UniswapExtension as the borrower and receive all the tokens on its own account
- The attacker can also supply liquidity and repay debts of its own using the UniswapExtenstion as the payer (`from`) and the attacker's accounts as the beneficiary (`to`).
- The attacker can take out all the ERC20 balances that the UniswapExtention contract holds
- It might be other unintended consequences of an attacker being able to call the uniswapV3SwapCallback() by deploying a Malicious Contract on an address that is computed as a valid UniswapV3/UniswapV2 pool, because of the complexity of the system and the time constraints of the audit contest, I was able to only come up with the previously mentioned consequences, which either of them can be devastating for the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The recommendation would be to create a type of whitelist for valid pools that can interact with the protocol.
  - And in the uniswapV3SwapCallback() **validate that the calling pool is indeed authorized by the protocol**. 
    - ***The fact that [the computed address by the UniswapV3Util.computeAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/libraries/UniswapV3Utils.sol#L30-L46) matches the `msg.sender` is not enough to validate that the caller is indeed a valid trusted UniswapV3 pool.***


```solidity
function uniswapV3SwapCallback(int256 amount0Delta, int256 amount1Delta, bytes calldata _data) external {
   ...
   UniV3SwapData memory data = abi.decode(_data, (UniV3SwapData));
   (address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint24 fee) = data.path.decodeFirstPool();
   address pool = getUniV3Pool(tokenIn, tokenOut, fee);

+  require(validPools[pool] == true && pool == msg.sender, "Unauthorized pool");

  ...
  ...

}
