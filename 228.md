# XDZIBEC-isValidSignature Function Does Not Check If Signature Is From A Contract

## Summary
- The `isValidSignature` function does not check if the signature is actually from a contract. This means that an attacker could easily forge a signature and trick the contract into thinking that it is from a valid contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
   ```solidity
 /// @notice Returns whether the provided signature is valid for the provided data
    /// @dev MUST return the bytes4 magic value 0x1626ba7e when function passes.
    /// MUST NOT modify state (using STATICCALL for solc < 0.5, view modifier for solc > 0.5).
    /// MUST allow external calls.
    /// @param hash Hash of the data to be signed
    /// @param signature Signature byte array associated with _data
    /// @return magicValue The bytes4 magic value 0x1626ba7e
    function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature) external view returns (bytes4 magicValue);
}
```
There is a vulnerability in  the `isValidSignature` function. so the problem here is that it does not check if the signature is actually from a contract. This means that an attacker could easily forge a signature and trick the contract into thinking that it is from a valid contract and this can  lead  to steal funds or perform other malicious actions.

## Impact
- An attackers could exploit this vulnerability and leading to steal funds or perform other malicious actions.
- The bug can be exploited by an attacker as this steps:
    - The attacker can forge a signature for the contract's address by using a signature generator.
    - The attacker can then use the forged signature to approve a transaction that sends their funds to another address.
    - The transaction will be approved because the contract will think that the signature was signed by a valid contract.
    - The attacker will then be able to steal the funds from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `isValidSignature` function should check if the signature is actually from a contract. This can be done by checking if the first four bytes of the signature are equal to the contract's address
