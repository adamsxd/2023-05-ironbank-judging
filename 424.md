# Lack of access control for absorb function

## Summary
The PToken `absorb` function is not controlled, even though there is a statement in the PToken that access control should be done.
## Vulnerability Detail
The description of the `absorb` function says `@dev This function should only be called by contracts`. However, there is no access control on this function.
## Impact
This function has the ability to mint PToken, which in some circumstances may benefit unrelated third parties.
