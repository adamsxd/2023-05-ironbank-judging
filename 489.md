# TxBuilderExtension.sol : `repayNativeToken` does not return the excess funds to the user.

## Summary

[repayNativeToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/TxBuilderExtension.sol#L290) has the logic when the `repayAmount > borrowBalance`, only the `repayAmount - borrowBalance` is transferred to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

as shown in below code, only the `repayAmount - borrowBalance` amount is sent to user when the condition `if (repayAmount > borrowBalance)` is satisfied.

    function repayNativeToken(address user) internal nonReentrant {
        uint256 repayAmount = msg.value;


        ironBank.accrueInterest(weth);
        uint256 borrowBalance = ironBank.getBorrowBalance(user, weth);
        if (repayAmount > borrowBalance) {
            WethInterface(weth).deposit{value: borrowBalance}();
            IERC20(weth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(ironBank), borrowBalance);
            ironBank.repay(address(this), user, weth, borrowBalance);
            (bool sent,) = user.call{value: repayAmount - borrowBalance}(""); --------------------------------->>> audit find
            require(sent, "failed to send native token");
        } else {
            WethInterface(weth).deposit{value: repayAmount}();
            IERC20(weth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(ironBank), repayAmount);
            ironBank.repay(address(this), user, weth, repayAmount);
        }
    }

## Impact

Any excess amount that was sent by user would be loss to the end user.
It may not be always possible to send the exact amount due to price updates.  So, in order to complete the transaction, user would send excess funds in order to fully repay.

We can attribute this situation to the real life situation too when we try to purchase something, at times we used to pay more and get in return what is left.

## Recommendation

    function repayNativeToken(address user) internal nonReentrant {
        uint256 repayAmount = msg.value;


        ironBank.accrueInterest(weth);
        uint256 borrowBalance = ironBank.getBorrowBalance(user, weth);
        if (repayAmount > borrowBalance) {
            WethInterface(weth).deposit{value: borrowBalance}();
            IERC20(weth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(ironBank), borrowBalance);
            ironBank.repay(address(this), user, weth, borrowBalance);

            (bool sent,) = user.call{value: repayAmount - borrowBalance}(""); -------------->> ----- remove 

            (bool sent,) = user.call{value: repayAmount}(""); --------------------------------->> ++++ add

            require(sent, "failed to send native token");
        } else {
            WethInterface(weth).deposit{value: repayAmount}();
            IERC20(weth).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(ironBank), repayAmount);
            ironBank.repay(address(this), user, weth, repayAmount);
        }
    }
