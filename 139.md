# Proxies should be Implemented Properly to avoid re-initialization or storage collisions.

## Summary
The `ironbank` , `DebtToken`, and `IBToken` makes use of proxies but doesn't lock the initializers and doesn't keep space for storage in case of future upgrades.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `ironbank `, `DebtToken`, and `IBToken` use the OZ `Initializable.sol` to initialize the contracts respectively however it doesn't lock the `initializer` function in the constructor making the contract liable to `re-intialization` attack where it could take ownership of those contracts.
Also note `OpenZeppelin` stated:

```solidity
 /**    
 *@dev Locks the contract, preventing any future reinitialization. This cannot be part of an initializer call.
     * Calling this in the constructor of a contract will prevent that contract from being initialized or reinitialized
     * to any version. It is recommended to use this to lock implementation contracts that are designed to be called
     * through proxies.
     */
```
Also, those `proxy` implementations do not leave space for extra `storage` to be used in case of future upgrades,
By reserving a `storage` gap, developers can ensure that future versions of the implementation contract can safely add or modify `storage` variables without overwriting the existing data stored by the proxy. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data stored in the `proxy` contract.
## Impact
The contracts could be `re-initialized` due to the no  `_disableInitializers()` and storage collision could occur which could be exploited due to no extra storage space.

## Recommendation
lock the `initializers` in the implementation contract:

```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
Leave space gaps for future `upgrades`
Here's an example of how a `storage gap` can be implemented in a contract:

solidity
Copy code
```solidity
// Proxy contract
contract Proxy {
    // Storage layout
    uint256 public storedData; // Existing storage variable
    uint256 private gap; // Storage gap

    // ...
}
```
In the above example, the `storedData` variable represents an existing storage variable in the proxy contract, while the `gap` variable is used as the `storage gap`. The gap variable ensures that any future upgrades to the implementation contract can introduce new storage variables without interfering with the existing data stored in the `proxy`.
