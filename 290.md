# collateralValue might overflow in some cases, denying access to core utilities of the protocol

## Summary
In [IronBank.sol#L1051](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L1051) there is a calculation of collateralValue performed in getAccountLiquidity. In some cases, due to multiple factors being multiplied at once, it may lead to overflow, due to which users may not be able to use core utilities of the protocol such as borrowing. This is very likely to happen with tokens that have 4 or less decimals, an such tokens exist - ([example](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#low-decimals)).

## Vulnerability Detail
The collateralValue is calculated as per the formula: `collateralValue += (supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * collateralFactor) / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE;`
exchange rate grows more with less decimals. A unit test used originally for testing liquidations has been used to demonstrate, that with 4 or less decimals, the test that was originally working, now is overflowing in getAccountLiquidity, which in this case denies the users possibility to borrow funds.

In order to fully demonstrate the results of the formula, for the sake of the test, IronBank.sol getAccountLiquidity both functions have been removed view parameter (it doesnt influence the poc) and additional event has been placed in order to display the formula values on-the-fly. Simply, an event was added: `emit CollateralValue(supplyBalance, exchangeRate, assetPrice, collateralFactor, 1e36, FACTOR_SCALE);`

To run the poc, manipulate its line 45:
`(market1,,) = createAndListERC20Market(5, admin, ib, configurator, irm, reserveFactor); `
Above, for 5 decimals the test will pass, and for 4 and less it will overflow at borrow attempt.

as per below screenshot it can be observed, that with decreasing decimals, the supplybalance increases and the rest of numbers stays with the same amount of decimals.

![collateralvalue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank-ArmedGoose/assets/120720673/1c470cde-a637-44c7-9c9d-096a0fff52ab)

![overflow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank-ArmedGoose/assets/120720673/efdeafee-bdfb-4041-a56a-93b36f794cfa)

While this also requires quite high price, that is a part of this formula, and that is hardcoded in the test, I understand that if such price was already input in the original test and everything is working with tokens above 4 decimals, then such price is something that the team expects to see and the unexpected factor here is the low decimal token, which is allowed in the protocol. 

## Impact
In some cases, of low decimals tokens, users will be unable to use the core protocol utilities - for example borrowing.
The risk is High because it denies ability to use promised core utility
The likelihood is Low because it is an edge case
Thus I assume overall severity is Medium

## Code Snippet
Run `forge test -vvvvv --match-test test_my_overflow_1` to see overflow
Change decimals of first token to 5 or more to see it work normally

## Recommendation
Safest way might be to disallow such low decimals tokens, as they are only part of all tokens available and the protocol already disallows some too large decimal ones. However, if the intention of the team is to use some specific tokens with low decimals, it might be required to do different formula for low decimal tokens, however it is difficult to propose anything that do not include division before multiplication. In my opinion, in some cases when there are just large amount of zeros, it might be possible to divide it upfront without causing a precision loss, but this may require further discussion.
