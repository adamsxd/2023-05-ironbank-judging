# totalSupplyUnderlying in supply function does not count reserve

## Summary
totalSupplyUnderlying in supply function does not count reserve

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently the  price of assetToken is calculated by dividing the sum of totalCash and totalBorrow over sum of totalSupply plus Reserve. However the totalSupplyUnderlying is calculated by `m.totalSupply * exchangeRate` only. The market can then have more supply than supplyCap given the total combined of reserve and totalSupply.

```solidity
        if (m.config.supplyCap != 0) {
            uint256 totalSupplyUnderlying = m.totalSupply * _getExchangeRate(m) / 1e18;
            require(totalSupplyUnderlying + amount <= m.config.supplyCap, "supply cap reached");
        }
```

## Impact
The market can have more supply than supplyCap given the total combined of reserve and totalSupply.
