# [M-4] PToken cannot wrap a rebasing token correctly

## Summary

PToken is a wrapped token that can only be used as collateral and cannot be borrowed out. However, it cannot wrap a rebasing token accurately because each time the token is rebased, the balance of the underlying token will change and there will be a difference between the underlying balance and the total supply of PToken. This means that users can receive different amounts of PToken for the same amount of underlying token depending on the appreciation/depreciation of the underlying balance in the PToken contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

PToken has an `absorb` function that allows a user to mint new PToken by sending the underlying token to the PToken contract.

        function absorb(address user) public {
                uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));

                uint256 amount = balance - totalSupply(); // This amount will change because of the change in balance variable.
                _mint(user, amount);
        }

However, if the underlying token is a rebasing token, such as AMPL, its balance will change periodically according to its rebase algorithm. This means that the `balance` variable in the `absorb` function will not reflect the actual amount of underlying token that the user sent to the PToken contract. Instead, it will include the effect of any previous rebases that occurred since the last `absorb` call.

This leads to two scenarios:

- If the underlying token appreciates due to rebase, then the `balance` variable will be larger than the totalSupply variable, and the user will receive more PToken than they should. This creates an arbitrage opportunity for users to get free PToken by calling absorb after a positive rebase.
- If the underlying token depreciates due to rebase, then the `balance` variable will be smaller than the totalSupply variable, and the user will receive less PToken than they should. This creates a disincentive for users to wrap their underlying token with PToken after a negative rebase.

## Impact

The newly minted PToken will not match the amount of underlying token that the user sent to the PToken contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are suggested options:
- Do not allow wrapping rebasing tokens with PToken.
- Tracking number of token deposited by users in a mapping instead of `balanceOf`.
