# Frontrun setCreditLimit

## Summary

You can frontrun `setCreditLimit` to extract as much value as possible before your credit limit is reduced.
## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious credit account can monitor the mempool to see if its credit limit is going to be reduced. When such a transaction appears in the mempool, he can frontrun a `borrow()` transaction to max out its credit limit.
## Impact

A credit account is able to borrow more than intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can use the same approach used to prevent frontrunning of approvals i.e. use increase / decrease credit limit instead of setting credit limit. If the new decreased credit limit is less than the amount that the user has already borrowed, it should revert.
