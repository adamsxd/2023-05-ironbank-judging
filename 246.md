# Increasing the liquidation threshold can make users instantly liquidatable

## Summary

When the `MarketConfigurator` increases the liquidation threshold, there is no time lock before the adjustment comes into effect. This can make users instantly liquidatable without giving them a chance to repay the debt or increase the collateral first. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When the owner of the market configurator calls ` adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold` and increases the liquidation threshold of a market, this change comes into effect instantly without considering if thereby any user becomes liquidatable. Since the liquidationThreshold is used to calculate if a user can be liquidated, changing it can lead to instant liquidations of users without giving the users time to either repay his debt or increase his collateral. 

Example:

Bob deposits WETH worth 1000. The market has a collateralFactor of 50% so Bob borrows USDC worth 500 USD. The liquidation factor for the WETH market 60% so as long as the collateral is worth equal or more than (500 * 60%/50%) =  600 USD Bob cannot be liquidated. The value of the WETH  collateral Bob has deposited drops to 600 USD but Bob is still not liquidatable since he still does not meet the liquidation criteria. 

If the `MarketConfigurator` increases the liquidation factor of WETH from 60% to 65%, now the collateral need to be worth equal or more than: 500*65%/50% = 650 USD. Bob becomes instantly liquidatable without the time to repay his debt or deposit more collateral. 

## Impact

Users get instantly liquidated without the time to repay the debt or deposit more collateral

## Recommendation

Implement a time lock when changing the liquidation threshold to give the user some time to repay the debt or increase the collateral to avoid liquidation.
