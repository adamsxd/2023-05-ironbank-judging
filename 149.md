# IBToken doesn't define the decimals to be used, by default will set it to 18 even though the underlying token has a different decimals than 18

## Summary
- IBToken doesn't define the decimals to be used, by default will set it to 18
  - When the marketDecimals are different than 18, the IBTokendecimals and the marketDecimals won't match.

## Vulnerability Detail

- If decimals() is not overridden on the IBToken contract, the [decimals will be set to 18, exactly as it is defined on the parent `ERC20Upgradeable` contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#L91-L93)
- The problem arises when attempting to transfer IBTokens, as explained in detail in the Impact section, the issue is that the magnitude used for the accounting of the marketToken inside the IronBank contract will be different than the magnitude that is used on the IBToken contract, operating using different magnitudes could lead to unexpected results and unwanted transfers of more tokens.

## Impact
- When interacting with the IBToken, the amounts of tokens won't be the same as the amount of tokens that are stored in the internal accounting of the IronBank contract.
- Users may be prompted to execute wrong transactions that will either revert or will update the balances in a different way than expected.
  - If a user would like to [transfer 10 IBTokens from one account to another and calls the transfer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/token/IBToken.sol#L71-L74), because the decimals on the IBToken are set as 18, the amount will be (`10 * 10**18`), suppose the marketDecimals are 8 and the user has enough balance on the IronBank contract to cover the transfer of (`10 * 10**18`), [the transaction will end up transferring a tremendous bigger amount of tokens than the user really wanted to transfer and its balance on the IronBank will be totally messed up](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L560-L572)
  - Also, depending on the usage that the protocol has for the emitted events it might cause major issues because when the events are emitted will show the values scaled up by the marketDecimals

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Make sure to **set the IBTokenDecimals to be the same as the marketDecimals.**
- Take as an example the same way of how the decimals are set for [DebtTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/token/DebtToken.sol#L50-L52) and [PTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/token/PToken.sol#L25-L27)
```solidity
    function decimals() public view override returns (uint8) {
        return ERC20(market).decimals();
    }
