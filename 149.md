# `CreditLimitManager.setCreditLimit()` does not check if a credit account has borrowed anything when setting the credit limit to 0

## Summary
When setting the credit limit to 0 for an account the function `CreditLimitManager.setCreditLimit()` does not check if the account has still borrowed something. This can lead to unintended liquidation if a former credit account wants to deposit collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the credit limit for the last market an account has a credit limit for is set to 0, the credit account turns into a normal account that can be liquidated. If this former credit account wants to deposit collateral to be able to borrow more he can be liquidated if the deposited collateral is less than the credit amount.

Example:
A Credit account has 1 Mil. USD worth of credit. He loses his credit line, and the credit limit is set to 0 making the account a normal account that can be liquidated. To borrow more the account wants to deposit 1 Mil. USD worth of ETH and 1 Mil. USD worth of BTC. This would make the collateral 2 Mil. USD and the account could borrow more. When depositing 1 Mil. USD worth of ETH the account becomes liquidatable since the collateral does not cover the whole credit because the max collateral Factor is 90%. The account is liquidated by a liquidation bot before he can deposit the remaining 1 Mil. USD worth of BTC. 

## Impact
Account gets liquidated and the owner looses his collateral

## Recommendation

Add a check if setting the credit limit for a market would make the credit account a normal account again. If so revert if the account still has borrowed anything
