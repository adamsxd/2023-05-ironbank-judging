# Liquidation Risk during Supply Pause

## Summary
The current smart contract design allows for liquidation of under collateralized borrowers even when the supply of a market is paused. This might prevent borrowers who are close to the `max_liquidation_threshold` from adding more supply to their collateral, to avoid being liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `setMarketSupplyPaused()` function allows the owner to pause or unpause the supply of a market. While it makes sense to have such controls in certain scenarios, the current implementation does not take into consideration users who are near liquidation.

In cases where a user's loan-to-value ratio is just below the max_liquidation_threshold and the supply gets paused, the user is prevented from adding more supply to their collateral in order to move away from the liquidation risk. If the price of the collateral decreases further, these users may find themselves being liquidated even though they were willing and able to add more collateral.

Even if `setMarketTransferPaused()` could be used to prevent this because ibTokens are directly related with supplied amount , there is no check internally that when calling `liquidate()` function, a liquidator tx will revert when reaching ibToken transfer, so in this case if supply is prevented, liquidation is not which is even more dangerous because a liquidator can transfer ibTokens when supplying is forbidden

## Impact
This vulnerability can put users who are near the `max_liquidation_threshold` at risk of liquidation, even if they intended to add more collateral. It is especially risky in volatile markets where asset prices can fluctuate rapidly. This could lead to loss of user funds, decreased platform usage and damaged reputation of the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
An alternative could be to implement a mechanism that prevents liquidation when supply is paused, although this might have other unintended consequences. 
```solidity
function liquidate(
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        address marketBorrow,
        address marketCollateral,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) external 
        nonReentrant 
        isAuthorized(liquidator) //E require(from == msg.sender || (!isCreditAccount(from) && isAllowedExtension(from, msg.sender)), "!authorized");
    {
        DataTypes.Market storage mBorrow = markets[marketBorrow];
        DataTypes.Market storage mCollateral = markets[marketCollateral];
        require(mBorrow.config.isListed, "borrow market not listed");
        require(mCollateral.config.isListed, "collateral market not listed");
        require(isMarketSeizable(mCollateral), "collateral market cannot be seized");
+       require(!mCollateral.isSupplyPaused(), "supply paused");
        require(!isCreditAccount(borrower), "cannot liquidate credit account");
        require(liquidator != borrower, "cannot self liquidate");
       
```
