# `getPriceFromChainlink`  doesn't implements the sequencer feed check. Therefore doesn't handle when L2 sequencer feeds such as arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds considering there no staleness threshold in place

## Summary
`getPriceFromChainlink`  doesn't implements the sequencer feed check. Therefore doesn't handle when L2 sequencer feeds such as arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds and since there is no staleness threshold set to check the `updatedAt` returned value, this can go on very longer than expected causing very stale prices to be read from the oracle. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage on critical stages such as liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check if sequencer is down before calling latestRoundData and also no staleness threshold check:
`
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
          (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote); 
          require(price > 0, "invalid price");

          // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
          return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    } 
`

## Impact
could potentially be exploited on many critical functions that makes call to or rely on the value returned from `getPriceFromChainlink` by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage. Most specifically the `_getLiquidationSeizeAmount` and `_isLiquidatable` which are called on the `liquidate` function both makes call to the `getPrice` function which rely on the values returned from `getPriceFromChainlink`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a staleness threshold check on the `updatedAt` value returned from the  `latestRoundData` function and implement the chainlink sequencer feed check. Code example of Chainlink: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code
