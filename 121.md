# Missing Stale Price Check in PriceOracle.sol

## Summary
Stale price vulnerability in PriceOracle.sol allows using outdated or incomplete price data from Chainlink feeds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getPriceFromChainlink` function in PriceOracle.sol uses the `latestRoundData` function to retrieve the latest price data from Chainlink. 
However, it does not include a check to ensure that the returned data is not stale or incomplete, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities or inaccuracies in the price information.

## Impact
The missing checks leave the system vulnerable to relying on outdated or unreliable price information, which can have various unintended consequences.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price, , , ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is strongly recommended to apply the proposed mitigation by incorporating the stale price check into the `getPriceFromChainlink` function in PriceOracle.sol. 
By implementing this mitigation, the system can ensure the usage of up-to-date and reliable price information, reducing the potential vulnerabilities and inaccuracies associated with stale or incomplete data.
```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(
    address base,
    address quote
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    try registry.latestRoundData(base, quote) returns (
        uint80 roundID,
        int256 price,
        uint256 timestamp,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    ) {
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(price > 0, "Chainlink answer reporting 0");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    } catch {
        revert("Error retrieving price from Chainlink");
    }
}
```
