# The impact of borrowing pause was not considered when calculating totalReserves in the _accrueInterest function.

## Summary
The impact of borrowing pause was not considered when calculating` totalReserves` in the  function `_accrueInterest`.

## Vulnerability Detail
If borrowing is paused, the increase of `interestFactor` and `feeIncreased ` should be halted to prevent `reservesIncreased` from increasing.Because the function ` _accrueInterest` is called during the functions `accrueInterest`, `redeem`, and `repay`, but the function `_accrueInterest` does not include a check for borrowing pause.

## Impact
 Otherwise, it may cause the `totalReserves` of the market to exceed the desired value set by the protocol. This, in turn, can lead to issues in the calculation of `_getExchangeRate`, result in incorrect calculations of the exchangerate when users attempt to calculate the exchangeRate between the underlying asset and ibToken.

```solidity
    function _accrueInterest(address market, DataTypes.Market storage m) internal {
        uint40 timestamp = _getNow();
        uint256 timeElapsed = uint256(timestamp - m.lastUpdateTimestamp);
        if (timeElapsed > 0) {
            uint256 totalCash = m.totalCash;
            uint256 borrowIndex = m.borrowIndex;
            uint256 totalBorrow = m.totalBorrow;
            uint256 totalSupply = m.totalSupply;
            uint256 totalReserves = m.totalReserves;
           
            uint256 borrowRatePerSecond =
                InterestRateModelInterface(m.config.interestRateModelAddress).getBorrowRate(totalCash, totalBorrow);
            // @audit-issue  lacks a check for borrowing pause. 
            uint256 interestFactor = borrowRatePerSecond * timeElapsed;
            uint256 interestIncreased = (interestFactor * totalBorrow) / 1e18;
            uint256 feeIncreased = (interestIncreased * m.config.reserveFactor) / FACTOR_SCALE;

            // Compute reservesIncreased.
            uint256 reservesIncreased = 0;
            if (feeIncreased > 0) {
                // @audit-issue The calculated reservesIncreased exceeds the desired value set by the protocol.
                reservesIncreased = (feeIncreased * (totalSupply + totalReserves))
                    / (totalCash + totalBorrow + (interestIncreased - feeIncreased));
            }

            // Compute new states.
            borrowIndex += (interestFactor * borrowIndex) / 1e18;
            totalBorrow += interestIncreased;
            totalReserves += reservesIncreased;

            // Update state variables.
            m.lastUpdateTimestamp = timestamp;
            m.borrowIndex = borrowIndex;
            m.totalBorrow = totalBorrow;
            m.totalReserves = totalReserves;

```solidity
   function _getExchangeRate(DataTypes.Market storage m) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // @audit-issue An increase in m.totalReserves will cause totalSupplyPlusReserves to increase, leading to an increase in the 
       // _getExchangeRate. This can result in incorrect calculations of the exchange rate when users attempt to calculate it.
        uint256 totalSupplyPlusReserves = m.totalSupply + m.totalReserves;
        if (totalSupplyPlusReserves == 0) {
            return m.config.initialExchangeRate;
        }
        return ((m.totalCash + m.totalBorrow) * 1e18) / totalSupplyPlusReserves;
    }
```

## Tool used
None

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To include the borrowing pause check in the calculation of interestFactor within the _accrueInterest function
