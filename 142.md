# `CreditLimitManager.setCreditLimit()` does not check if a credit account has collateral when setting the credit limit to 0

## Summary
When setting the credit limit to 0 for an account the function `CreditLimitManager.setCreditLimit()` does not check if the account has collateral. This can lead to unintended liquidation of former no credit accounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
If an account has deposited collateral into a market and is “promoted” to a credit account be being given a credit line, accidently changing the credit line to 0 would make the account a normal account again and can make the deposited collateral subject to liquidation.

Example:
AccountA deposits collateral to marketA and borrows actively. Since accountA is such a good customer the Iron Bank gives it a credit line of x and makes the account a credit account that can not be liquidated. AccountA still has its collateral in the bank because moving it is not practical at the moment. AccountA borrow against the credit limit and exceeds the value of its collateral. The Iron Bank wants to adjust the credit limit of accountA and accidently sets it to 0, making the accountA a normal account again that is open to liquidation. Since the account has borrowed more than the collateral is worth it gets liquidated even though the bank did not intend the account to become a normal account. 
  

## Impact
AccountA looses its collateral and does not interact with the bank again because of this bad experience.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid this scenario a check should be added to the function `CreditLimitManager.setCreditLimit()` that gets triggered when the new limit is equal to 0 and checks if the account has collateral.
