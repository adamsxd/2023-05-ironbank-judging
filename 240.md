# msg.value can be reused multiple times

## Summary

`msg.value` can be reused to take ETH that is stuck on `TxBuilderExtension.sol` and `UniswapExtension.sol` 

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the `execute()` function allows you can chain multiple function calls in a single call e.g. `TxBuilderExtension.repayNativeToken()` or `UniswapExtension.supplyNativeToken()`, you can reuse `msg.value` multiple times by calling these functions multiple times but only providing enough eth for a single action. This is the [same vulnerability](https://samczsun.com/two-rights-might-make-a-wrong/) that samczsun found in sushiâ€™s miso contracts.

Assume that there is 1 ETH stuck on the `TxBuilderExtension.sol` contract. A user can call `execute()` with the following actions `[supplyNativeToken, supplyNativeToken, redeemNativeToken]` and a `msg.value` of 1 eth. The first supplyNativeToken uses the eth that is transferred by the user. The second supplyNativeToken uses the eth that is stuck on the contract. The redeemNativeToken is used to redeem 2 ETH. 

## Impact

Both the `TxBuilderExtension.sol` and `UniswapExtension.sol` contracts implement the `seizeNative()` function to retrieve ETH that is stuck on these contracts. This function is gated by an `onlyOwner()` modifier. However, as a result of this vulnerability, a user is also able to bypass this restriction to retrieve the stuck funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a local variable to track `msg.value`. When a function that uses `msg.value` is executed, subtract from this local variable instead of reusing `msg.value`.
