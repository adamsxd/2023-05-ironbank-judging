# Full redemption with outstanding borrow balance.

## Summary

when redeeming assets , users are not allowed to fully redeem  assets if the have outstanding borrow balance. to ensure this the redeem function checks if it is a full redemption triggered by the user and if the user has zero balance. if both are true the user is allowed to exit the market. In the case that the user has requested a full redemption but has a non zero borrow balance , they will be denied to exit the market but the code continues to fully redeem assets  for  the  user.

## Vulnerability Detail

         if (isRedeemFull && _getBorrowBalance(m, from) == 0) {
            _exitMarket(market, from);
        }

        IBTokenInterface(m.config.ibTokenAddress).burn(from, ibTokenAmount); // Only emits Transfer event.
        IERC20(market).safeTransfer(to, amount);

        _checkAccountLiquidity(from);

As shown users are only  allowed to exit the market if they have zero outstanding borrow balance. This check however does not prevent users from fully redeeming assets if the have a non zero borrow balance. 

NOTE : users who not aware that they can only fully redeem assets if they have zero outstanding borrow balance might assume full redemption can always be performed regardless of their borrow balance. 
## Impact

users assets might get locked in the market leading to loss of usability or liquidity.

## Recommendation
Add a checking mechanism to prevent users from fully redeeming assets if the have a borrow balance >  0 .
