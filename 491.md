# Storage Slot Collision Due to Contracts Upgrade

## Summary
The IronBank Contract is an upgradeable contract, inheriting and implementing different libraries and contracts. But there was an oversight.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
//@audit-issue uses ReentrancyGuard instead of ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable 
contract IronBank is
    Initializable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuard,
    IronBankStorage,
    IronBankInterface
{
```
The IronBank doesnot use the ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, instead it uses the reentrancy guard openzeppelin contract.


## Impact
Upgradeable contracts have a use in the system because they have Storage Gaps which avoid storage slots collision when future up grades happen,

## Recommendation
