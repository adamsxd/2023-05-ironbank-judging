# ExchangeRate of markets which hold 6 decimal tokens (USDC) can be manipulated

## Summary
With the first deposit, exchangeRate can be manipulated to be a huge value. This will lead the following users that deposit to receive an unjustified amount of ibTokens in exchange for their ERC20 when calling `IronBank.supply`.

## Vulnerability Detail
While initialExchangeRate is dynamically according to the markets token decimals, the formula to calculate the amount of `ibToken` to receive is static:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L323

The should ensure initialExchangeRate that ibTokens are minted 1:1 to the ERC20 when minting for the first time. From there, ibTokens are minted 1:1 or higher (ib 1 : <1 ERC20).
Calculating the exchangeRate is done in the following way: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L805-L810
`total ERC20 tokens * 1e18 / (m.totalSupply + m.totalReserves)` ensures that this ratio is maintained and cannot go lower (due to reserves).

The problem is that when supplying (and thus minting) for the first time, the exchangeRate calculation is skipped and 1e6 is used as exchangeRate. 

1. First deposit of the contract: user deposits 1wei USDC via `ironBank.supply`. Assume there is no supply cap
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L323
2. Above is used to calculate ibTokens, which is 1 * 1e18 / exchangeRate
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L807-L808
3. Exchange rate = initialExchangeRate since there is no `m.totalSupply` yet = 1e6
4. This results to 1 * 1e18 / 1e6 = 1e12 ibTokens. Which should have been 1e6.
5. The magic is: we send 1wei (or any value actually) ibToken to a random address via `ibToken.transfer`. Our balance is now ibToken: 999999999999 (9e11), ERC20: 1
6. Now, when we call redeem the following gets calculated:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L423
Which leads to 0 due to rounding error (9e11*1e6 = 9e17;
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L435-L437
`m.totalCash = 1 - 0`, `m.totalSupply = 1e6 - 999999999999`

The next time `exchangeRate` is calculated it leads to:
`(1 * 1e18) / 1 = 1e18`
## Impact
Manipulated exchangeRate
## Code Snippet
The teams actually has a POC on this:

function testExchangeRate1e6Manipulation() public {
        uint256 market2SupplyAmount = 1;

        vm.startPrank(admin);
        market2.approve(address(ib), market2SupplyAmount);
        ib.supply(admin, admin, address(market2), market2SupplyAmount);
        ibToken2.transfer(user1, 1);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(admin);
        ib.redeem(admin, admin, address(market2), type(uint256).max);
        vm.stopPrank();

        /**
         * admin market2 amount = 0.999999
         * total cash = 0.000001
         * total borrow = 0
         * total supply = 1 wei
         * new exchange rate = 10 ** (-6) / 10 ** (-18) = 10 ** 12
         */
        // exchange rate has been manipulated 10^12 times
        assertEq(ib.getExchangeRate(address(market2)), 10 ** (underlyingDecimals2 + 12));
        assertEq(ib.getTotalCash(address(market2)), 1);
        assertEq(ib.getTotalBorrow(address(market2)), 0);
        assertEq(ib.getTotalSupply(address(market2)), 1);
        assertEq(ib.getTotalReserves(address(market2)), 0);
    }
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Exchangerate here is manipulated in a similar way as to any AMM where initial liquidity is not provided. 
Seeing `testExchangeRate1e6ManipulationFailed`, the teams is actually aware this and "preventing" this by depositing initial liquidity.

But what the team didn't realize (or forgot) is that it can be frontrun by someone who deposits 1wei.

Mitigation:
Either mint at _init or implement code that fetches the correct decimals in:
