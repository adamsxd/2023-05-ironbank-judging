# Owner can steal all `underlying` tokens of `PToken` if used a proxied token

## Summary

If `PToken` contract is used with `underlying` as a token with more than one address (proxy), owner could steal all tokens from that contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There are some tokens that have more than one address because they're proxied, as described [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#multiple-token-addresses).

If some of those tokens are used as `underlying` in `PToken` contract in a future, it could result in a theft of all tokens held by `PToken` done by the owner of that contract.

## Impact

Owner of `PToken` contract can easily steal all `underlying` tokens of that contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended to double-check by the protocol owners if a token is proxied to avoid a theft of tokens in `PToken` contract.
