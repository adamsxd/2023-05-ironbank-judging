# Returned values of Chainlink Oracle are not verified

## Summary
Chainlink Oracle returned values are not handled properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink oracle return values are not handled properly, the priceFeed will return the following variables:

- roundId
- startedAt
- timeStamp
-answeredInRound

These returned values are meant to be used to do some extra checks before updating the price. By just using the answer, the contract may get stale prices and incomplete rounds.

## Impact
The returned price can be outdated.

```diff
-   (, int256 price, , , ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote));
+   (uint80 roundID, int256 price, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote));
+   require(answer > 0, "" Chainlink price <= 0"");
+   require(answeredInRound >= roundID , "" Stale price "");
+   require(timestamp != 0, "" Round not complete "");"
```
