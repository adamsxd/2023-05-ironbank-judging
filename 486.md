# Delisting market will not delete userBorrows and userSupplies

## Summary
Delisting market will not delete mappings userBorrows and userSupplies.

## Vulnerability Detail
Deleting structs that contain dynamic datatypes does not delete the dynamic data. When the market is delisted all variable in struct `Market` should be deleted but that is not true.

## Impact
If the market is listed again all borrows/supplies of users will stay.
