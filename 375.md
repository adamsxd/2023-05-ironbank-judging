# The `repay` function `reverts` if the `amount` passed in the ` input` is greater than the `repay amount`.

## Summary
In the `repay` function, if the `amount`  passed as input is greater than the `amount` to be repaid, the function reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
After the `external` `repay`  function has been called, it reverts due to the the `require` `statement` in the ` internal` `_repay` function that checks if the amount passed as input is ` equal` to the amount to be `repaid` and if not, the call `reverts` which also leads to `loss` of `gas` by `user`.

```solidity
  function repay(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(from) {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
        if (isCreditAccount(to)) {
            require(from == to, "credit account can only repay for itself");
        }

        _accrueInterest(market, m);

        _repay(m, from, to, market, amount);
    }
      // require statement in the internal function _repay
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            amount = borrowBalance;
        }

        require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
 ```

## Impact
Users may have to make multiple calls before the function `call` `runs` which can lead to users losing their gas.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`Refund` the user the `surplus` amount before the internal function `_repay` is called.
