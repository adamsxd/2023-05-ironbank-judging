# Critical Bug in Delisting

## Summary
Delisting of a market requires deleting various parameters in the struct and array
But there is an issue here.


## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function delistMarket(address market) external onlyMarketConfigurator {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        delete markets[market];
        allMarkets.deleteElement(market);

        emit MarketDelisted(market);
    }
```
The markets mapping is mapped to a struct that contains another mapping. The values of this mapping remains in storage of the contract after deletion
## Impact
If the market is ever listed back, it would bring in a lot of collision due to previously stored values in the mapping. Iteration over this mapping would bring up too many issues which can be exploited
