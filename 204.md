# No use of upgradeable SafeERC20 and ReentrancyGuard contracts in IronBank contract

## Summary
- The IronBank contract is an upgradeable contract and it uses the upgradeable version of a couple contracts like `Ownable2StepUpgradeable`, `UUPSUpgradeable`, but is not using the upgradeable version of the `SafeERC20` & `ReentrancyGuard` contracts

## Vulnerability Detail
- Not using the upgradeable version of SafeERC20 and ReentrancyGuard contracts on the IronBank contract, instead is using the normal versions which are not upgradeable compatible. Not using the upgradeable version of the contracts will make that the storage is initialized in the context of the OZ contract instead of in the context of the inherited contract.

## Impact
- Not using the upgradeable version of the mentioned contracts will make that the storage of those contracts is not initialized in the context of the inheriting contract (IronBank contract), and it could potentially cause issues and lead to unexpected behavior after performing an upgrade to the IronBank contract

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make use of Open Zeppelin [upgradeable version of the SafeERC20.sol contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol) and also the [upgradeable version of the ReentrancyGuard.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol)
