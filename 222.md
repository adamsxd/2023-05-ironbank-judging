# User could become not liquidatable

## Summary

User could become not liquidatable. 

## Vulnerability Detail

During `liquidation()` call the `IronBank.sol` contract checking if the `borrower` address is currently `liquidatable` using the `_isLiquidatable` function:
```solidity
File: IronBank.sol
480:     function liquidate(
481:         address liquidator,
482:         address borrower,
483:         address marketBorrow,
484:         address marketCollateral,
485:         uint256 repayAmount
486:     ) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(liquidator) {
...
498:         // Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
499:         require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");
```

`_isLiquidatable` on its turn going through `borrower`'s `allEnteredMarkets` counting its `debtValue` and `liquidationCollateralValue`. However, this function could be DOS at some number of markets and depending on the chain's block gas limit. This would make `borrower` not liquidatable. 

## Impact

User could become not liquidatable by entering a big number of markets, leading to the DOS of the `liquidate` function because out of gas on the `_isLiquidatable` call.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a limitation on the number of markets that users could enter.
