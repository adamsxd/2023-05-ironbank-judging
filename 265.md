# Loans with one collateral are subject to higher liquidation risk than multi-collateral loans

## Summary

Loans with one collateral are subject to higher liquidation risk than multi-collateral loans.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `liquidate` function in `IronBank.sol` allows anyone to liquidate a user's position. The function first checks if the user's position is undercollateralized. If so the `repayAmount` is repaid and an equivalent amount of `marketCollateral` plus a bonus fee is transferred to the liquidator.

The issue is that this function only accepts one collateral as an argument, which makes loans backed by only one collateral subject to higher liquidation risk.

For example:
- Alice supplies 3000 USDC and borrows 1 ETH.
- Bob supplies 1000 USDC, 1000 USDT, and 1000 DAI and borrows 1 ETH.
- The price of ETH raises, which makes both loans to be undercollateralized.
- Alice is liquidated and has her 3000 USDC seized.
- Bob is liquidated and has 1000 USDC seized. But after the partial repayment, Bob's loan is no longer undercollateralized, so the rest of the collateral cannot be seized.

## Impact

Users with loans backed by only one collateral are subject to higher liquidation risk than users with loans backed by multiple collateral.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

a) Accept multiple collaterals as an argument in the `liquidate` function and allow to use of all of them to reward the liquidator.
b) Allow only to liquidate the loans partially until the loan is no longer undercollateralized.
