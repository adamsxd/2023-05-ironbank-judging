# No time lock when transfer for market gets unpaused

## Summary

If a markets gets trnasfarePaused, the collateral in it can not be liquidated/seized. But if the markets transfer gets unpaused again there is no time lock to give users the opportunity to increase the collateral or repay the debt in case the price of the underlying has fallen, and the user has become liquidatabel.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example:

Bob deposits 1000 USD worth of tokenA into the market and borrows 500 USDC against it. The collateral factor is 50% and the liquidation threshold is 60%. This means that as long as the collateral is worth equal or more than 600 USDC Bob is save from liquidation. Now the market of tokenA gets paused because of a certain issue. During the pause the value of the collateral in marketA drops to 500 USD, making Bob liquidatabel. But since the market is transfarePaused no liquidation of the market is possible. Once the issue is solved and the marketConfigurator unpaused transfares for marketA again Bob gets immediately liquidated. He does not have the time to increase his collateral to avoide liquidation. 

## Impact

User gets liquidated even if he would have preferred to increase his collateral to avoide liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a time lock when unpausing the transfer of a market to give the users time to deposit additional collateral or repay debt in case they have become liquidatable during the pause
