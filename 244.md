# Frontrun setUserExtension

## Summary

You can frontrun `setUserExtension` to extract as much value as possible before you are removed as an extension.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a malicious user (B) is a user extension of A, B can monitor the mempool to see if A is trying to remove him as a user extension. When he spots this transaction in the mempool, he can bundle it together with other transactions to extract as much value from A before he is removed as a user extension.
## Impact

Since the `isAuthorized()` modifier is used in the `supply()`, `redeem()`, `borrow()`, `repay()` and `liquidate()`, these are the functions that can potentially be impacted. For example, the malicious user B can redeem on behalf of A and specify `to` as itself. A similar attack can be done on supply and borrow as well.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can use the same approach used to prevent frontrunning of approvals i.e. allow the user to specify how much extension to give and use increase/decrease user extension. User extension is always reduced (like allowance) whenever an action is performed on behalf of a user.
