# CreditLimitManager's Owner role's powers can result in liquidation of creditAccount. Guardian role should be segregated

## Summary
In the CreditLimitManager contract, pauseCreditLimit() function can be called by both Owner and Guardian. In addition, owner can call setCreditLimit() for any account.

The pauseCreditLimit is designed for CreditAccount() to ensure further borrowing is disabled, while making sure that the account is not liquidated. As owner can call both functions, calling setCreditLimit() by mistake can result in liquidation of unintended positions.

This implementation also does not segregate the roles and responsibilities for Owner and Guardian.
Owner as super power 
a) should be able to set Guardian.
b) able to set creditLimit for non credit accounts

and leave the pausing of credit to Guardian role as per the documentation on the website.

[role of Guardian](https://docs.ib.xyz/governance)
`Reduce credit limit to $1 for a specific account, preventing it to borrow further without making it a non-credit-limit account`
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Incorrect choosing of function by owner to set creditlimit on an account can result in liquidation of unintended account.  Also, role are not properly segregated. 

## Impact
Unintended Liquidation of CreditAccount.

## Code Snippet

**Pausing Credit Limit for Credit Account**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/CreditLimitManager.sol#L80-L84

```solidity
 function pauseCreditLimit(address user, address market) external onlyOwnerOrGuardian {
        require(IronBankInterface(ironBank).isCreditAccount(user), "cannot pause non-credit account");

        // Set the credit limit to a very small amount (1 Wei) to avoid the user becoming liquidatable.
        IronBankInterface(ironBank).setCreditLimit(user, market, 1);
    }
```

**Setting Credit Limit**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/CreditLimitManager.sol#L80-L84

```solidity
 function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 creditLimit) external onlyOwner {
        IronBankInterface(ironBank).setCreditLimit(user, market, creditLimit);
    }
```

**Modifier onlyOwnerOrGuardian**
```solidity
 modifier onlyOwnerOrGuardian() {
        require(msg.sender == owner() || msg.sender == guardian, "!authorized");
        _;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) rename the modifer as onlyGuardian and change the logic to check against guardian as below
```solidity
 modifier onlyGuardian() {
        require(msg.sender == guardian, "!authorized");
        _;
    }
```
2) Assign the onlyGuardian() modifier to pauseCreditLimit() function.

3) update the setCreditLimit function to check for account to be not CreditAccount, before setting the new creditLimit.
```solidity
 function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 creditLimit) external onlyOwner {
        require(!IronBankInterface(ironBank).isCreditAccount(user), "cannot set for credit account");
        IronBankInterface(ironBank).setCreditLimit(user, market, creditLimit);
    }
```
Let guardian handle until it remains as creditAccount by locking the creditLimit to 1.
