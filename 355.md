# delisted Market is not properly deleted

## Summary
Deleting the struct `markets`that has 2 mappings , doesn't delete the mapping leaving `userSupplies` and `userBorrows`  mappings in contract  storage. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In line [604](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L603), when delisting a market , you are deleting the struct in order to remove the data associated to this market. [Market](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/libraries/DataTypes.sol#LL30C11-L30C11)` struct has two mappings and when deleting the struct these mapps are not deleted , they will remain in contract storage. 

## Impact
Deleting a struct that contains a mapping will not delete the mapping contents which may lead to unintended consequences. If this market is listed again, the newly listed market will be created with the old  `userSupplies` and `userBorrows` data.
## Code Snippet
``` solidity 
delete markets[market];
 ```
  
``` solidity 
  struct Market {
        MarketConfig config;
        uint40 lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 totalCash;
        uint256 totalBorrow;
        uint256 totalSupply;
        uint256 totalReserves;
        uint256 borrowIndex;
        mapping(address => UserBorrow) userBorrows;
        mapping(address => uint256) userSupplies;
    }
```

## Recommendation
Deleting the mapp first then delete the struct
