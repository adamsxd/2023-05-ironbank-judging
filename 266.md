# Unhandled Chainlink price feed revert can result in bad debt

## Summary

If Chainlink price feed is not available the liquidation process will not be available, which might cause the protocol to become insolvent.

## Vulnerability Detail

The execution of `PriceOracle.sol:getPriceFromChainlink()` will revert if the Chainlink price feed is not available or the return data does not pass the validation. 

During certain exceptional circumstances, Chainlink oracles may become inaccessible or token prices might plummet to zero. In such scenarios, the liquidation process will be halted, as all calls will revert, thereby affecting debt holders who possess these tokens. Paradoxically, these instances are often crucial times when allowing liquidations would be vital to maintaining the solvency of the protocol.

## Impact

At crucial moments, the protocol may face a situation where liquidations become unattainable, despite being highly necessary. Consequently, the value of users' assets may decline to a level lower than their outstanding debts, leading to a loss of liquidation incentives and ultimately pushing the protocol toward insolvency.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Instead of directly invoking the `latestRoundData()` function, enclose it within a try-catch block. In the event that the call encounters a revert, the catch block can be utilized to invoke a fallback oracle or handle the error appropriately based on the specific requirements.
