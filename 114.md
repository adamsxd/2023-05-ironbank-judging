# Oracle contract doesn't check for outdated price data

## Summary
You should check whether the data from Chainlink is outdated before using it.

## Vulnerability Detail
There have been instances in the past where Chainlink oracles have stopped posting new data. That caused protocols to work with outdated data opening up arbitrage opportunities, e.g. chainlink returns a higher price for a collateral token than it should.

## Impact
The protocol can potentially work with outdated data.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check whether `block.timestamp - roundTimestamp == heartbeat`
