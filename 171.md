# Liquidation Reverts When Malicious Borrowers Repay a Small Amount Through MEV

## Summary
In IBToken.sol `liquidate()`, liquidation reverts when the input repay amount is greater than the current borrower balance. This makes the whole liquidation process vulnerable to malicious borrowers' MEV attacks. A borrower can simply front run liquidation transactions by repaying a small amount when a liquidator is repaying in full or most of the debts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In IBToken.sol `liquidate()`, the liquidator would enter a repay amount which is directly passed through internal `_repay()`. In `_repay()`, the input repay amount is compared with `borrowBalance` in a require statement, and at the time of transaction execution, if the repay amount is more than `borrowBalance`, the transaction reverts.
```solidity
//IronBank.sol
    function _repay(
        DataTypes.Market storage m,
        address from,
        address to,
        address market,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, to);
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            amount = borrowBalance;
        }
        require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
```
```solidity
//IronBank.sol 
//liquidate()
        repayAmount = _repay(
            mBorrow,
            liquidator,
            borrower,
            marketBorrow,
            repayAmount
        );
```
Liquidator bots will maximize profits by liquidating the full or most of the borrower debts. And in this case, a malicious borrower would only need to call `repay` on IronBank.sol for a small fraction amount of the debts (1 wei as an example), and front run liquidator's transaction, this will cause liquidators transactions to revert.
## Impact
Liquidations revert. In extreme case, protocol market might become insolvent.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise `_repay` to allow repay amount to be `borrowBalance` when it is larger than `borrowBalance`.
