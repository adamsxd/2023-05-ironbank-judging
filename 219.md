# Missing checks for whether L2 Sequencer is active

## Summary
Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum Sequencer is still [active](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum).
## Vulnerability Detail
If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.
During downtime, L2 will be down for most users but available for a few users. These users can force transactions from L1 taking advantage of the incorrect price. It would be unfair to continue service without reverting when only a few users can use them to their advantage.
## Impact
Stale prices can be used for malicious users.
## Code Snippet
Chainlink oracles are used, but there are no sequencer oracles in use:
```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(
        address base,
        address quote
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price, , , ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return
            uint256(price) *
            10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }

```

## Recommendation
Use a [chainlink oracle](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-use-chainlink-price-feeds-on-arbitrum/#almost_done!_meet_the_l2_sequencer_health_flag) to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
