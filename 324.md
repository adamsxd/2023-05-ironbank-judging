# `IronBank#_getExchangeRate()` disregards recently accrued interest

## Summary

`IronBank#_getExchangeRate()` often underestimates the exchange rate as it fails to account for interest accrued since the most recent operation. This inaccuracy ripples through many other pieces of the code base and would primarily impact external `view` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

`IronBank#_getExchangeRate()` depends on one particular piece of data that is a function of time: `m.totalBorrow`. It reads this value directly from storage, assuming that the cached value is good enough. Throughout most of the `IronBank`, calls to `_getExchangeRate()` are properly preceded by calls to `_accrueInterest()` (which updates `m.totalBorrow` in storage). However, there are several instances where this is not true, and so the exchange rate is outdated.

First, there are many external `view` functions which go directly to `_getExchangeRate()` without first invoking `_accrueInterest()` (which is non-`view`). Inaccuracy in the following functions would most likely impact external integrations which depend on liveness of price data:

- `IronBank#getExchangeRate()`
- `IronBank#getTotalBorrow()`
- `IronBank#getSupplyBalance()`
- `IronBank#getAccountLiquidity()`

Inaccuracy in the next batch of external `view` functions would most likely impact users of the protocol, including liquidation bots, which may fail to spot genuine liquidation opportunities until storage is updated:

- `IronBank#isUserLiquidatable()`
- `IronBank#calculateLiquidationOpportunity()`

Finally, there is also one core piece of system functionality which utilizes the outdated exchange rate: `IronBank#_checkAccountLiquidity()`. Inaccuracy here could enable the liquidity check to pass even if the account is at risk when accounting for all interest. The internal `_checkAccountLiquidity()` function is utilized within two external functions without a preceding call to `_accrueInterest()`:

- `IronBank#checkAccountLiquidity()`
- `IronBank#deferLiquidityCheck()`

## Impact

Varied:
- Difficulty to amass external integrations due to lack of liveness
- Ineffectiveness of liquidation bots operating on old data
- Potentially errant liquidity checks

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include some extra functionality inside `IronBank#_getExchangeRate()` to compute an updated version of `m.totalBorrow` if it's outdated. Something like this:

```solidity
function _getExchangeRate(DataTypes.Market storage m) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalSupplyPlusReserves = m.totalSupply + m.totalReserves;
    if (totalSupplyPlusReserves == 0) {
        return m.config.initialExchangeRate;
    }

    uint256 totalCash = m.totalCash;
    uint256 totalBorrow = m.totalBorrow;
    uint256 timeElapsed = uint256(_getNow() - m.lastUpdateTimestamp);

    if (timeElapsed > 0) {
        uint256 borrowRatePerSecond =
            InterestRateModelInterface(m.config.interestRateModelAddress).getBorrowRate(totalCash, totalBorrow);
        uint256 interestFactor = borrowRatePerSecond * timeElapsed;
        uint256 interestIncreased = (interestFactor * totalBorrow) / 1e18;

        totalBorrow += interestIncreased;
    }

    return ((totalCash + totalBorrow) * 1e18) / totalSupplyPlusReserves;
}
```

Of course, we should also reconcile this redundancy with the `IronBank#_accrueInterest()` function so as not to end up with duplicate code, but that is outside the scope of this PoC.
