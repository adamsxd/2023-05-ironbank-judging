# Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData Might Return Stale Results

## Summary
The code snippet provided contains a vulnerability related to potential usage of stale prices from Chainlink's latestRoundData() function. The vulnerability report suggests adding checks to mitigate the risk of using outdated or unreliable price information.

## Vulnerability Detail
When retrieving data from Chainlink's latestRoundData() API, there are no checks for stale data. This can result in the utilization of outdated price information, which may cause financial losses to end-users relying on accurate and up-to-date price data.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that it can lead to the usage of stale prices across various functions in the affected contracts. Without proper checks, the code may rely on outdated price data, potentially resulting in incorrect contract behavior and financial losses for users.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L67

    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");
    /..
    }

    function _setAggregators(Aggregator[] calldata aggrs) external onlyOwner {
                 /..
                (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(aggrs[i].base, aggrs[i].quote);
                require(price > 0, "invalid price");    
                /..
    }
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Consider adding the missing checks for stale data.
For example:

    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint80 roundID, int256 price,, uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");
    require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
    require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
