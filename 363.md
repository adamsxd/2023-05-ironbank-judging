# Anyone can call `absorb` to absorb excess `underlying` asset.

## Summary
The function `absorb` can be called by both `EOA` and `contracts` instead of only `contracts`  to absorb the `surplus` `underlying asset` in the `Ptoken` `contract`, due to lack of checks.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `code` `comment`, the function absorb should only be called by contracts, but there are no `checks` in the code to ensure that only `contracts` can call this `function`. so; anyone can drain the `surplus` `underlying` `asset`
```solidity
     */@notice Absorb the surplus underlying asset to user.
     // @dev This function should only be called by contracts.
     // @param user The beneficiary to absorb the surplus underlying asset
     */
 function absorb(address user) public {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 amount = balance - totalSupply();
        _mint(user, amount);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`Add` `require` and `checks` to make the `function` only `callable` by `contracts`.
