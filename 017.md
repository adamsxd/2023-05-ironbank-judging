# In case if market is delisted then suppliers can't redeem their ibToken

## Summary
In case if market is delisted then suppliers can't redeem their ibToken
## Vulnerability Detail
`IronBank.delistMarket` function [will mark market as not active](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L603) and remove the state of market.
Protocol team said:
> The delistMarket function will be called after the market has been paused and the collateral factor has been set to zero by the governance. The Iron Bank team will assess the impact on the remaining suppliers of the market when the collateral factor is set to zero. If the total borrow amount is relatively low, we will cover all debts using our protocol reserves.

In case if `delistMarket` will be called on market, where totalSupply is not 0, then it will be not possible for holders [to redeem their shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L412).
## Impact
Stake holders will not be able to redeem.
