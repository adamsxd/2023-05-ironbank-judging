# If users enter too many markets, they will not be able to exit.

## Summary
Functions with gas consumption exceeding the block's gas limit will not be able to complete.
The `deleteElement` function in the Arrays library loops through the number of elements in the largest case, but this may exceed the gas limit, in which case the function reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_exitMarket` of ironbank, `allEnteredMarkets[user].deleteElement(market)` tries to delete the market from the array.
However, if the `deleteElement` process exceeds the gas limit, the function always reverts.
## Impact
Functions containing `_exitMarket` can no longer be invoked.
