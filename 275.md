# XDZIBEC- Incorrect maximum collateral factor

## Summary

- The `maximum collateral` factor in the Constants contract is incorrect. The value is set to `9000`, when it should be set to `10000`. This means that borrowers can only borrow `90%` of the loan `amount`, which is not enough to cover the risk of default. If a borrower borrows more than `90%` of the loan `amount`, and the value of the `collateral` falls below the loan `amount`, the borrower will be liquidated. This means that the `borrower` will lose their `collateral`, and they will still owe the remaining `balance` of the loan.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity 
abstract contract Constants {
    uint256 internal constant INITIAL_BORROW_INDEX = 1e18;
    uint256 internal constant INITIAL_EXCHANGE_RATE = 1e18;
    uint256 internal constant FACTOR_SCALE = 10000;

    uint16 internal constant MAX_COLLATERAL_FACTOR = 9000; // 90%
```
- There is a vulnerability in the` abstract contract Constants`, especially in the line  `uint16 internal constant MAX_COLLATERAL_FACTOR = 9000; // 90%` here the maximum collateral factor should be `10000`, not `9000`. This is because the `collateral` factor represents the percentage of the `loan` that is backed by `collateral`. A maximum `collateral` factor of `9000` means that the `borrower` can only borrow `90%` of the loan `amount`, which is not enough to cover the risk of default.

## Impact

- If an attacker exploit this vulnerability it could lead to losing money if they borrow more than `90%` of the loan `amount`.

## Recommendation
-change the value of `MAX_COLLATERAL_FACTOR` to `10000`.
