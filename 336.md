# userBorrows and userSupplies arrays may still contain their previous values even after the market is delisted

## Summary

In the `delistMarket()` function is responsible for delisting a market by deleting its data from the markets mapping and removing its address from `allMarkets`.

```solidity=!
function delistMarket(address market) external onlyMarketConfigurator {
    DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
    require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

    delete markets[market];
    allMarkets.deleteElement(market);

    emit MarketDelisted(market);
}
```

However, using the `delete` keyword to delete the markets struct will not delete the values of the arrays inside it.

Therefore, the `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` arrays may still contain their previous values even after the market is delisted

## Vulnerability Detail

For example:

1. Alice's `userSupplies` in the market struct is `100` USDT, where `userSupplies` is an array inside the USDT market struct.

```solidity=!
struct Market {
    MarketConfig config;
    uint40 lastUpdateTimestamp;
    uint256 totalCash;
    uint256 totalBorrow;
    uint256 totalSupply;
    uint256 totalReserves;
    uint256 borrowIndex;
    mapping(address => UserBorrow) userBorrows;
    mapping(address => uint256) userSupplies;
}
```

2. When the `hardDelistMarket()` function is called, it will execute the `delistMarket()` function and use the `delete` keyword to delete the USDT market configuration.

3. However, using the `delete` keyword to set the USDT `Market` struct to its default state will only delete the struct itself. It will not delete the values stored in the arrays within the struct.

```solidity=!
function delistMarket(address market) external onlyMarketConfigurator {
    DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
    require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

    delete markets[market];
    allMarkets.deleteElement(market);

    emit MarketDelisted(market);
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L599-L607

4. Therefore, the `userSupplies` of Alice in this market will still be `100` USDT even after the delisting process.

5. Furthermore, if a previously delisted market is listed again, it can potentially lead to invalid calculations in functions such as the `getSupplyBalance()` function.

## Impact

In the case where a market has been delisted and then listed again, the `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` arrays may still contain some remaining values. This can lead to invalid calculations or operations that rely on the values stored in these arrays.

## Recommendation

Reset the `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` arrays for that market to their default state after delisting the market.
