# Users can `borrow` with `zero` `collateral.`

## Summary
In the function `borrow`, users can borrow and enter the market with zero collateral due to transferring before checking if user has enough collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `borrow`, the check for if the `borrower` has enough collateral to be able to borrow comes after the call to `_entermarket` and `safetransfer` of funds has been called which leads to borrowing and entering the market with no collateral.
```solidity
function borrow(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        isAuthorized(from)
    { 
   
// more code ...
 if (m.config.borrowCap != 0) {
            require(newTotalBorrow <= m.config.borrowCap, "borrow cap reached");
        }

        // Update storage.
        unchecked {
            m.totalCash -= amount;
        }
        m.totalBorrow = newTotalBorrow;
        m.userBorrows[from].borrowBalance = newUserBorrowBalance;
        m.userBorrows[from].borrowIndex = m.borrowIndex;

        // Enter the market.
        if (amount > 0) {
            _enterMarket(market, from);
        }

        IERC20(market).safeTransfer(to, amount);

        if (isCreditAccount(from)) {
            require(from == to, "credit account can only borrow to itself");
            require(creditLimits[from][market] >= newUserBorrowBalance, "insufficient credit limit");
        } else {
            _checkAccountLiquidity(from);
        }

        emit Borrow(market, from, to, amount, newUserBorrowBalance, newTotalBorrow);
    }
```

## Impact
Malicious actors can drain the contract using the `borrow` function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `_checkaccountliquidity` call should be made before `safetransfer` of funds to the users.
