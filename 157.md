# Users may be completely DOS'd due to OUT_OF_GAS attacks

## Summary
Out of gas error may occur/ be forced  in `_isLiquidatable` which will lead to a user being completely unable to call any function but `supply()` in IronBank

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `borrow()`, `redeem()`, `liquidate()` and `transferIBTokens()`, account liquidity is checked and `_isLiquidatable()` is called.
The current way `isLiquidatable()` works is by iterating over `userEnteredMarkets[user]`. 
```solidity
address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
            if (!m.config.isListed) {
                continue;
            }

            uint256 supplyBalance = m.userSupplies[user];
            uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, user);

            uint256 assetPrice = PriceOracleInterface(priceOracle).getPrice(userEnteredMarkets[i]);
            require(assetPrice > 0, "invalid price");
            uint256 liquidationThreshold = m.config.liquidationThreshold;
            if (supplyBalance > 0 && liquidationThreshold > 0) {
                uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(m);
                liquidationCollateralValue +=
                    (supplyBalance * exchangeRate * assetPrice * liquidationThreshold) / 1e36 / FACTOR_SCALE;
            }
            if (borrowBalance > 0) {
                debtValue += (borrowBalance * assetPrice) / 1e18;
            }
        }
``` 
This has multiple issues with it:
1. A user can enter and exit market endless times. When exiting the market, the market's slot is replaced with the  `0x0` address in the `userEnteredMarkets[user]`.  The current implementation goes through it and every time does the costly operation to open the storage slot for the 0x0 address to check if the market is listed. Accessing such struct is costly considering the complexity of both `MarketConfig` and `Market` structs. Therefore, only entering and exiting a single market numerous times may lead to this OUT_OF_GAS error.
2. Lack of limit of markets a user can enter.
3. For every asset, external call to oracle is made, costing a lot of gas 
4. Combined with my other gas griefing issue - adversary can call `supply()` for another user for as low as 1 wei, entering the market for them. After calling any function which calls `isLiquidatable()`, the function will go over the market + call to the oracle, making the function much more costly 


## Impact
User completely being unable to use IronBank. 100% loss of user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
before accessing the storage slot for the market, check if `userEnteredMarkets[i] == address(0)``and continue the for loop if so. 
add access control to who can supply for a user. consider a minValue for supplying
add a limit to markets a user can enter
