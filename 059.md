# Credit accounts accepted by the Credit Limit Mangers should only be Smart Contracts and not EOA's

## Summary

Credit accounts are able to borrow form Iron Bank without providing collateral. The development team has indicated these accounts should only be smart contracts, although the function that sets the credit limit (therefore marking the address as a credit account) can be set for EOA's (externally owned contracts).  There is no check to ensure that the account being set is a smart contract and not an EOA. 

To quote the documentation: "To elaborate, the borrower must be a contract deployed on the chain of which it wishes to borrow, the borrowed funds go to where the contract predefines without exception"

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `setCreditLimit()` is responsible for marking an address as a `creditAccount`. 

Although this function can only be called by the `creditLimitManager`, if such manager authorises a limit on an EOA, the owner of that address can borrow without providing collateral. 

## Impact

EOA's that are given credit limits will be able to borrow from the Iron Bank without providing collateral. (Something for nothing)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A simple solution would be to include a modifier that ensures credit limits are only assigned to smart contracts and not EOA's 

```solidity
//Throws if the account is an EOA
   modifier onlyContract(address) {
        require(address != tx.origin, "Caller must not be EOA Address");
        _;
    }

 function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 credit) external onlyContract onlyCreditLimitManager  {
      DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        if (credit == 0 && creditLimits[user][market] != 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].deleteElement(market);
        } else if (credit != 0 && creditLimits[user][market] == 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].push(market);
        }

        creditLimits[user][market] = credit;
        emit CreditLimitChanged(user, market, credit);
    }

```
