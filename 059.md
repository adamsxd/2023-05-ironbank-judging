# Credit accounts accepted by the Credit Limit Mangers should only be Smart Contracts and not EOA's

## Summary

Credit accounts are able to borrow form Iron Bank without providing collateral. The development team has indicated these accounts should only be smart contracts, although the function that sets the credit limit (therefore marking the address as a credit account) can be set for EOA's (externally owned contracts).  There is no check to ensure that the account being set is a smart contract and not an EOA. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `setCreditLimit()` is responsible for marking an address as a `creditAccount`. Through discussions with the development team, we find. 

"In order to qualify as a credit account, the contract must have a mechanism to calculate its external collateral. For instance, a strategy contract that borrows a single asset and farms CRV on a Curve pool would consider the deposited LP tokens + collectable CRV rewards as external collateral. "

Although this function can only be called by the `creditLimitManager`, if such manager authorises a limit on an EOA, the owner of that address can borrow without providing collateral. 

## Impact

EOA's that are given credit limits will be able to borrow from the Iron Bank without providing collateral. (Something for nothing)

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A simple solution would be to include a modifier that ensures credit limits are only assigned to smart contracts and not EOA's 

```solidity
//Throws if the account is an EOA
   modifier onlyContract(address) {
        require(address != tx.origin, "Caller must not be EOA Address");
        _;
    }

 function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 credit) external onlyContract onlyCreditLimitManager  {
      DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        if (credit == 0 && creditLimits[user][market] != 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].deleteElement(market);
        } else if (credit != 0 && creditLimits[user][market] == 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].push(market);
        }

        creditLimits[user][market] = credit;
        emit CreditLimitChanged(user, market, credit);
    }

```
