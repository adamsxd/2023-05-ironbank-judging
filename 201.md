# `softDelistMarket` does not correctly credit users for earned fees prior to updating the `reserveFactor`

## Summary

Although `softDelistMarket` updates the `reserveFactor` for a given market, it doesn't first call `accrueInterest` for that market, which can result in lost fees for users

## Vulnerability Detail

All calls which can alter the interest rate model or reserve factor for a market are required to first call `accrueInterest` for that market. This is because those variables affect the amount of fees which will be paid out for users. This is done correctly in the `changeMarketInterestRateModel` and `adjustMarketReserveFactor` functions. However, there is no call of `ironBank.accrueInterest(market)` in the `softDelistMarket`. This can result in lost fees for users.

## Impact

`softDelistMarket` does not call `accrueInterest` for the given market prior to updating the `reserveFactor`, which can result in lost fees for users
