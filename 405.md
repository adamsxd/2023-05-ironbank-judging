# Excess funds after a swap are not returned to the user.

## Summary
If the _amountin_  after a swap is less than the specified _maxswapinamount_  it is required that these excess funds be returned to the user. 

## Vulnerability Detail
     Univ3
        require(amountIn <= maxSwapInAmount, "swap in amount exceeds max swap in amount");
        uniV3AmountInCached = DEFAULT_AMOUNT_CACHED;
    }
        Univ2

        require(amountIn <= maxSwapInAmount, "swap in amount exceeds max swap in amount");
        uniV2AmountInCached = DEFAULT_AMOUNT_CACHED;
    }


As we can we see it is required that the _amountin_ ( actual amount spent ) is less than or equal to the _maxswapinamount_ specified by a user . if  _amountin_ < _maxswapinamount_ , the excess ( i.e maxswapinamount  -  amountin ) should be returned back to the user or else it will result in a loss of value to the user. This has not been considered here.

## Impact
It will result in loss of value to users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check the difference between _amountin_ and maxswapinamount and refund it to the _msg.sender_.
