# Unsafe downcasting/casting could lead to silent underflow/overflow and end up reverting swap transactions

## Summary
- Unsafe downcasting/casting exposes the risk to silent underflow/overflow when casting the received amount of tokens out of the swaps

## Vulnerability Detail
- Unsafe downcasting/casting the amounts of tokens that were received out of the swaps before comparing the received amounts against the min/max amounts that were defined as part of the slippage protection mechanism
- As a result of unsafely downcasting/casting the tx may revert even though the received amount of tokens was correct, this could lead to a self-DoS when doing swaps


## Impact
- Unsafe downcasting/casting exposes the risk to silent underflow/overflow, thus, if an underflow/overflow occurs in the reported lines, the slippage protection mechanism may revert the transactions because the casted values won't accurately reflect the received amount of tokens that were received out of the swaps, this could lead to a self-DoS when doing swaps

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use `OpenZeppelin SafeCast` library, they provide a battle-tested [function to safely convert a signed int256 into an unsigned uint256.](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/utils#SafeCast-toUint256-int256-)
- Take as an example the correct safeCasting from uint256 to int256 on these lines.
