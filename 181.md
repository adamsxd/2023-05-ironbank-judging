# Liquidation Reverts Due to MEV Attacks

## Summary
A malicious borrower can repay a small fraction of debt by front-running liquidation transactions to prevent being liquidated.
## Vulnerability Detail
In IronBank.sol `liquidate()`, liquidator input a `repayAmount` which is directly passed to interal `_repay()`. In `_repay()`, this amount is checked against current `borrowBalance`. And if the amount is greater than current `borrowBalance`, `_repay()` will revert and reverting the liquidation transaction.
```solidity
//IronBank.sol
    function liquidate(
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        address marketBorrow,
        address marketCollateral,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(liquidator) {
        DataTypes.Market storage mBorrow = markets[marketBorrow];
        DataTypes.Market storage mCollateral = markets[marketCollateral];
        require(mBorrow.config.isListed, "borrow market not listed");
        require(mCollateral.config.isListed, "collateral market not listed");
        require(
            isMarketSeizable(mCollateral),
            "collateral market cannot be seized"
        );
        require(!isCreditAccount(borrower), "cannot liquidate credit account");
        require(liquidator != borrower, "cannot self liquidate");

        _accrueInterest(marketBorrow, mBorrow);
        _accrueInterest(marketCollateral, mCollateral);

        // Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
        require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");

        // Repay the debt.
        repayAmount = _repay(
            mBorrow,
            liquidator,
            borrower,
            marketBorrow,
            repayAmount
        );
       ...
```
```solidity
    function _repay(
        DataTypes.Market storage m,
        address from,
        address to,
        address market,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, to);
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            amount = borrowBalance;
        }
 |>       require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
      ...
```
However, the require statement is vulnerable to MEV attacks. When a liquidator liquidates full or majority of the borrower's debt, a malicious borrower could simply repay a minimal amount front running the liquidator's transaction, such that when liquidator's transaction settles, liquidator's repayAmount would be greater than user borrowBalance, causing liquidation to revert. This attack is easy and cheap to carry out and the attacker could repay as low as 1 wei to front run and revert liquidation when liquidator liquidates full.

It should also be noted although theoretically `repayAmount` is at the choice of the liquidator, and should the liquidation transaction only liquidate a small portion of the borrower's debt, the borrower can still front run but needs to repay a larger portion of the debts which is not profitable. However, in most cases liquidator bots would look for the arbitrageur opprotunity and take out flash loan to maximally liquidate an account for maximized profits, so the scenario where a liquidator see a profitable opportunity but the bot is programmed to only liquidate a small portion of the debt is minimal. In addition, even though a liquidator chooses to liquidate only a small amount of debt, another liquidator can still subsequently liquidate the rest of the borrower debt, and the malicious borrower can still prevent itself from being fully liquidated by repaying a small fraction. 
## Impact
Liquidation reverts due to MEV attack. And in situations where mass liquidation is needed, or whale borrowers seek to prevent itself from being liquidated, the protocol is at risk of bad debts and insolvency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not revert when liquidator inputs a `repayAmount` that is more than user current balance. Instead, change the `repayAmount` to equal `borrowBalance`.
