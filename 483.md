# PToken.sol : `function absorb` is public and it can be called by anyone

## Summary

`PToken.sol` has the [absorb ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/token/PToken.sol#L63-L69) function which will be called by the contracts to absorb the any surplus amount of asset.

But the function is public and can be called by any by inputting the user address as argument.

## Vulnerability Detail

     * @notice Absorb the surplus underlying asset to user.
     * @dev This function should only be called by contracts.
     * @param user The beneficiary to absorb the surplus underlying asset
     */
    function absorb(address user) public {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));


        uint256 amount = balance - totalSupply();
        _mint(user, amount);
    }

It is clear and the function could be called by anyone since it has `public` modifier.

## Impact

Anyone can call and have the surplus token in their custody.
When the asset price is determined in any of the function call using the contract's balance, the bad actor can forcefully inject these assets which would cause the asset price manipulation.
