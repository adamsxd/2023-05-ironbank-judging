# precision loss in some formulas

## Summary
In solidity, division before multiplication results in poor calculation accuracy.
In this project, some formulas use division before multiplication. This leads to a constant face of calculation accuracy.
## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity does not employ virtually any decimals, resulting in extreme calculation results such as 1 / 2 = 0.
Therefore, before performing division, as much as possible, calculations such a multiplication should be done first.
## Impact
Error in calculation of protocol-critical values.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Bring division to the end of the calculation
