# `getPriceFromChainlink` function might return stale results

## Summary

In the `PriceOracle` contract, you are using Chainlink’s latestRoundData API, but there are missing checks, for example, `updatedAt` property is not extracted and validated.

## Vulnerability Detail

Missing multiple validation checks, only `price > 0` was performed which is totally insufficient.

## Impact

For instance not checking how stale the answer is could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation and even to entirely drained protocols.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
67: (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
68: require(price > 0, "invalid price");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding the missing checks:

```diff
-- (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);

++ (uint80 roundId, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
++ require(roundId>= answeredInRound, “Wrong oracle data”);
++ require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
++ require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= MAX_ORACLE_FRESHNESS_SECONDS>, "Last price update was too long ago.");
```
