# It is possible to set the liquidationThreshold below a previous collateralFactor if the collateral factor is adjusted before

## Summary
If the market configurator decides to reduce the `collateralFactor` of a market and subsequently also reduces the `liquidationThreshold` of the market the Threshhold can be set below the old `collateralFactor` and make users that have borrowed up to the old collateral factor instantly liquidable.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `collateralFactor` of marketA is 90% and the `liquidationThreshold` is 95%. Because the underlying of markteA has become a less safe asset, the market configurator sets the `collateralFactor` to 80% and the `liquidationThreshold` to the corresponding 85%. All users that have borrowed up to the 90% of their deposits in marketA (assuming they have only one collateral) will be instantly liquidated.

## Impact

Unexpected liquidations for users that erode the trust in the iron Bank

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Before changing the `liquidationThreshold`, checking what the last `collateralFactor` was and not allowing a lower `liquidationThreshold` could avoid this cenario
