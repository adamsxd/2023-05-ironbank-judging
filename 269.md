# XDZIBEC-onDeferredLiquidityCheck() function only allows the IronBank contract to call it

## Summary
The `onDeferredLiquidityCheck()` function in the` FlashLoan` contract only allows the `IronBank `contract to call it. this is prevents other contracts from checking the liquidity of the` FlashLoan` contract. an atatcker could allow malicious contracts to exploit the` FlashLoan` contract and drain its liquidity.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/// @inheritdoc DeferLiquidityCheckInterface
    function onDeferredLiquidityCheck(bytes memory encodedData) external override {
        require(msg.sender == ironBank, "untrusted message sender");
        (IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, address token, uint256 amount, bytes memory data, address msgSender) =
            abi.decode(encodedData, (IERC3156FlashBorrower, address, uint256, bytes, address));

        _isDeferredLiquidityCheck = true;
        _loan(receiver, token, amount, data, msgSender);
    }
```
- There is a bug in the  `onDeferredLiquidityCheck()` function, the problem is this line `require(msg.sender == ironBank, "untrusted message sender");` will only allow the` IronBank` contract to call the `onDeferredLiquidityCheck()` function. This is a security risk, because it prevents other contracts from checking the liquidity of the `FlashLoan` contract 
## Impact
- an attacker  allow malicious contracts to exploit the `FlashLoan` contract and drain its liquidity.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- it's should do this `require(msg.sender == address(ironBank) || msg.sender == address(receiver), "untrusted message sender");` it's will allow the `IronBank` contract and the receiver contract to call the` onDeferredLiquidityCheck()` function. This will allow other contracts to check the liquidity of the `FlashLoan` contract, which will improve the security of the contract.
