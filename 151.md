# High Decimal Vulnerability in Token Price Normalization

## Summary
In the README.DOC there is this sentence saying "USDC, USDT, wstETH, WBTC, WETH, DAI and other vanilla ERC20s" but protocol only allow tokens with decimals number below 18, otherwise it will revert the g`etNormalizedPrice()` from PriceOracle.sol.
This function fails to handle tokens with a decimal count above 18 (e.g. YAM-V2 has 24), which could lead to incorrect price normalization and issues within the financial system, including manipulation and inaccuracy.

[REF : Weird ERC-20#HighDecimals](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#high-decimals) 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the getNormalizedPrice function, the price of a token is normalized by multiplying it by 10 ** (18 - decimals). This works fine for tokens with up to 18 decimals, as is the standard for many ERC20 tokens. However, for tokens with a decimal count above 18, the calculation could result in a negative exponent, leading to an incorrect price normalization.

This issue could create potential manipulation opportunities for tokens with high decimal counts. It could also lead to inaccurate pricing information being propagated throughout the system.

## Impact
This high decimal vulnerability could have significant effects on the operations of a financial system, leading to incorrect price calculations, potential market manipulation, and affecting the credibility and accuracy of financial transactions within the system.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L80
```solidity
    function getNormalizedPrice(uint256 price, address asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(asset).decimals();
        return price * 10 ** (18 - decimals); //@audit-issue underflow fail with decimal token more than 18 
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A check should be introduced in the getNormalizedPrice function to ensure that tokens with a decimal count above 18 are either handled correctly or explicitly disallowed. If tokens with high decimals are intended to be supported, the price normalization logic should be revised to handle these cases correctly.
```solidity
require(decimals <= 18, "Token has too many decimals");
```
