# accrueInterest is underestimating interest rate because it doesn't compound

## Summary
Interest rate is not calculated optimally because it's possible `accrueInterest` isn't called very frequent. This way the actual interest rate calculated is different than if `accrueInterest` would've been called every block , because the function doesn't use compounding in it's calculation.
## Vulnerability Detail
Accrue interest is called from various functions to update various state variables before doing any other actions such as supplying, borrowing, redeeming and so on. The function calculates the interest by getting the interest rate per second, it multiplies that with the time difference passed between the last call of this method. It's possible the `accrueInterest` hasn't been called frequently, example once a week. However, if this method would have been called every block the interest rate would be bigger because of compounding. It's possible for markets that are less used the time between function calls is greater and thus the actual interest rate will be significantly lower than it should be.

## Impact
Discrepancy between the computed and theoretical interest since if `accrueInterest` has not been called in a block or if it would've been called every block the actual interest rate will differ. The difference between the actual interest rate and the theoretical will depend on the time difference between function calls and the actual interest rate itself. If the interest rate itself is higher, the lack of compounding will result in a higher difference.
