# User can prevent liquidations if enough markets exist

## Summary
If Ironbank were to grow to the same extent as a protocol like Balancer, then there could be enough markets for a user to be able to have an unhealthy borrow position without the risk of being liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail
A liquidator is likely to follow the following steps before/while performing a liquidation:

1. Calls `isUserLiquidatable` to see if an account is liquidatable
2. Calls `calculateLiquidationOpportunity` to calculate the size of the opportunity
3. Calls `liquidate` with the desired amount of asset to repay

In both of these above calls, the `_isLiquidatable` internal method is called. Importantly, this method loops through all the user entered markets. Thus, a malicious actor could join an arbitrary number of markets to gas grief liquidators (particularly relevant on Ethereum) or with enough markets the malicious actor could even cause any liquidation attempts to revert.

Furthermore, the malicious actor doesn't even need to commit capital to these markets. Not only is there no lower limit to amount in the `supply` method, but an attacker can redeem all their capital with `redeem` without exiting the market. As shown in the snippets below, this is possible because `isRedeemFull` is only true if `amount == type(uint256).max`. The malicious actor could therefore specify the exact amount of their position to withdraw all their capital without exiting the market.

```solidity
        bool isRedeemFull;
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            ibTokenAmount = userSupply;
            amount = (ibTokenAmount * _getExchangeRate(m)) / 1e18;
            isRedeemFull = true;
        }
```

```solidity
        if (isRedeemFull && _getBorrowBalance(m, from) == 0) {
            _exitMarket(market, from);
        }
```

Therefore, for example, a malicious actor could have "positions" in 100 markets, where every position has a supply of 0. They could then borrow against a market with a collateral token that has an unusually high price. As the value of their collateral decreases, the borrow/user becomes liquidatable. 

With sufficient markets, the malicious actor could listen for any `liquidate` calls in the mempool and frontrun these transactions to join another market. This would cause `_isLiquidatable` to iterate over so many markets that the liquidator transaction runs out of gas or reaches the block gas limit.

I spent a lot of time debating whether or not this is a low or medium severity issue but decided it was medium because there is no hard-stop from preventing this situation from occurring. It feels like one of those things that could sit in the background for years before appearing and causing reputational damage. Furthermore, the contest README suggests the number of markets could grow indefinitely to support any "vanilla ERC20s".

## Impact
Malicious actor can borrow against unhealthy collateral and prevent anyone from liquidating their position.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Firstly, the `_exitMarket` condition check in `redeem` should use the same logic as `_repay` by checking for `m.userSupplies[to] == 0` rather than using the `isRedeemFull` variable. This will prevent the malicious attacker from having 0 value market positions.

Secondly, I would suggest a cap on the number of markets that a user can enter. You could add the following line to the `_enterMarket` method:

```solidity
require(allEnteredMarkets[user].length < MAX_MARKET_LENGTH, "too many markets");
```

where `MAX_MARKET_LENGTH` is a sensible constant of your choosing.
