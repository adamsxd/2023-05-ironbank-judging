# XDZIBEC-userBorrows mapping does not have a default value

## Summary
- The userBorrows mapping does not have a default value, which can lead to unexpected behavior
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    struct Market {
        MarketConfig config;
        uint40 lastUpdateTimestamp;
        uint256 totalCash;
        uint256 totalBorrow;
        uint256 totalSupply;
        uint256 totalReserves;
        uint256 borrowIndex;
        mapping(address => UserBorrow) userBorrows;
        mapping(address => uint256) userSupplies;
    }
}
```
- There is a bug in the `Market` struct, the problem is that line of code that is  creates a mapping from addresses to` UserBorrow` structs. The `UserBorrow` struct has two fields`: borrowBalance` and `borrowIndex`. The` borrowBalance` field stores the amount of tokens that an address has borrowed, and the `borrowIndex` field stores the index of the loan in the market's loan list.
The problem with that line is that it does not include a default value for the `UserBorrow` struct. This means that if an address does not have any loans, the `userBorrows` mapping will still have an entry for that address. This entry will have a `borrowBalance` of `0` and a `borrowIndex` of `0`.
## Impact
- If an address tries to borrow `tokens` from the `market`, but the address does not have any loans, the `userBorrows` mapping will still have an entry for that address. This will cause the` borrowBalance` field to be set to `0`, even though the address has not borrowed any `tokens`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- to fix the vulnerability use this :
```solidity
mapping(address => UserBorrow) userBorrows = {};
```
This line of code creates a mapping from addresses to `UserBorrow` structs, and it sets the default value for the `UserBorrow` struct to an empty struct. This will prevent the `userBorrows` mapping from having entries for addresses that do not have any loans.
