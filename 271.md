# XDZIBEC- Incorrect PAUSE_BORROW_MASK constant can lead to unexpected behavior

## Summary

- The `PAUSE_BORROW_MASK` constant in the `PauseFlags` library is incorrect. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the `borrowPaused` flag being set even if the paused value is false. This can have a negative impact on the market, such as users being able to borrow `tokens` even though the market is `paused`.

## Vulnerability Detail

  ```solidity 
/// @dev Sets the market borrow paused.
    function setBorrowPaused(DataTypes.MarketConfig memory self, bool paused) internal pure {
        self.pauseFlags = (self.pauseFlags & PAUSE_BORROW_MASK) | (toUInt8(paused) << PAUSE_BORROW_OFFSET);
    }

    /// @dev Returns true if the market borrow is paused, and false otherwise.
    function isBorrowPaused(DataTypes.MarketConfig memory self) internal pure returns (bool) {
        return toBool(self.pauseFlags & ~PAUSE_BORROW_MASK);
    }
```
- The bug is in the `PAUSE_BORROW_MASK` constant, this constant is set to the value `0xFD`, which is equal to `253` in decimal, the `PAUSE_BORROW_OFFSET` constant is set to the value `1`, which means that the `paused` boolean value is shifted by `one` bit before being `ORed` with the s`elf.pauseFlags` value, this means that the `paused` value is only checked for the first bit, and the other bits are ignored, this can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the `borrowPaused` flag being set even if the paused value is false.

## Impact

- This vulnerability   can lead to unexpected behavior, and they can be exploited by malicious actors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The correct value for the `PAUSE_BORROW_MASK` constant is `0xFE`, which is equal to `254` in decimal. This value will ensure that the `paused` value is checked for all bits before being `ORed` with the `self.pauseFlags` value.
