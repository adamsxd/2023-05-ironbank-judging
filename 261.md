# Users can get immediately liquidated if market liquidation threshold is decreased

## Summary

Users can get immediately liquidated if market liquidation threshold is decreased.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `MarketConfigurator` contract allows the owner to change the liquidation threshold of a market. If the liquidation threshold is decreased for a market that has open positions, some users may get immediately liquidated without time to react.

## Impact

Users can get liquidated without time to react.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Some possible solutions:
- Use a time lock in case of liquidation threshold decrease for a market that has open positions.
- Keep track of the original liquidation threshold and use it for open positions, so that the change will only affect new positions.
