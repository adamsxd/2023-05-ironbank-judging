# Insufficient cash validation in function borrow.

## Summary

In the process of borrowing assets the code checks if a market has sufficient cash to  fulfill a borrow request. The function however, does not check if it has sufficient cash for a specific asset which might lead to a given borrowed asset being undercollateralized. this is because the market total cash is the sum of the available cash of different assets ( i.e weth , seth , usdc ). 

## Vulnerability Detail

 require(m.totalCash >= amount, "insufficient cash");
 
this line is supposed to check if the market has sufficient cash to fulfill a borrow request. In the event that a user borrows a given asset let say weth , but the available cash amount weth is insufficient the contract might believe has enough cash although in reality the weth cash is insufficient.  The contract will then proceed to issue weth to the user while  being silently undercollateralized.

## Impact
 
A given borrowed asset gets undercollateralized while the users continue to borrow it.
