# _loan() Function does not check borrow before and after

## Summary

The `flashLoan()` function may encounter issues when interacting with tokens that don't revert on failure and return true for every transaction, without proper balance checks.

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, there is no mechanism in place to control the resulting balance after a `safeTransfer()` operation. This leaves the possibility for a token to successfully execute the transfer without updating its internal accounting, which could lead to the balance of an `FlashLoan` contract being stolen.

## Impact

Some tokens in the market may not return the whole amount back, but will report successful `safeTransfer()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Checking the pool balance both before and after executing a flash loan, and reverting the transaction if the expected number of tokens is not returned.
