# UniswapExtension.uniswapV3SwapCallback will not work for !isExactInput

## Summary
UniswapExtension.uniswapV3SwapCallback will not work for !isExactInput, because no transfer will be performed to the middle pools in the path.
## Vulnerability Detail
In order to pay uniswap pool for the swap, UniswapExtension.uniswapV3SwapCallback should transfer output token.
This is done correctly for the [`isExactInput` case](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/UniswapExtension.sol#L283).

But for the `isExactInput` case, token transfer [is located inside `else` clause](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/UniswapExtension.sol#L317), which means that for the pools in the middle of path transfer will not be performed, so swap will be reverted by uniswap then.
## Impact
It will be not possible for user to close his short position that he already opened.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do it in same way as it's [done for uniswap v2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/extensions/UniswapExtension.sol#L422). Transfer should be outside of if/else.
