# Oracle does not check if anwser returned from chainlink is in valid range

## Summary

According to [chianlink's documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits), the latest answer returned should be checked against reasonable limits.

## Vulnerability Detail

There's not check whether the latest answer is in valid range.

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

## Impact

The latest answer returned could be wrong if the actual price goes outside minAnswer and maxAnswer. This happened during luna crash.
