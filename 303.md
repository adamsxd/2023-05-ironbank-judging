# Zero-value transfers of `IBToken` prohibited

## Summary

`IBToken` prohibits zero-value transfers, which breaks compliance with EIP-20.

## Vulnerability Detail

`IBToken` should comply with EIP-20 to maximize compatibility with existing DeFi applications. [EIP-20 expressly states](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#transfer):

> _Note_ Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event.

The `IBToken` transfer logic, encapsulated within `IronBank#_transferIBToken()`, prohibits zero-value transfers, thereby violating the ERC20 token standard.

## Impact

Failure to comply with EIP-20 could present composability issues for `IBToken`, as many other smart contracts may not protect against the zero-value case.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the zero-value transfer restriction from `IronBank#_transferIBToken()`.
