# accrueInterest should be called before setMarketConfiguration

## Summary
IronBank._accrueInterest should be called before setting a new market configuration.
## Vulnerability Detail
In IronBank.sol ```_accrueInterest``` is called on every important action like borrowing or supplying. This function is used to accrue interest to the current timestamp. There is a specific instance where it should also be called. While it is fully rightful for market configurator to change market config settings, this one important step of calling ```_accrueInterest``` is overlooked. Changing market config can also lead to changing ```m.interestRateModelAddress```, where new instance can have different parameters from previous version. Changing those parameters will change the behaviour of ```_accrueInterest``` function retroactively since ```m.lastUpdateTimestamp```. It is essential to ensure that changing the parameters of interestRateModel and therefore behaviour of ```_accrueInterest``` only take effect on the future.

## Impact
To ensure fairness and prevent unexpected consequence for borrowers (gains or losses) it is important to call ```_accrueInterest``` before changing market configuration. If this is skipped, various issues can arise, including interest rate calculation for past being incorrect and protocol not functioning as expected.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function setMarketConfiguration(address market, DataTypes.MarketConfig calldata config)
        external
        onlyMarketConfigurator
    {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        m.config = config;

        emit MarketConfigurationChanged(market, config);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Suggested refacturing: 
```solidity
function setMarketConfiguration(address market, DataTypes.MarketConfig calldata config)
        external
        onlyMarketConfigurator
    {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
        _accrueInterest(market, m);

        m.config = config;

        emit MarketConfigurationChanged(market, config);
    }
```
