# IronBank: _getAccountLiquidity() & _isLiquidatable() might run out of gas due to for loop

## Summary
Both` _getAccountLiquidity()` & `_isLiquidatable()` iterate through all of the `userEnteredMarkets`. Both of these functions have gas intensive operations such as state updates, and calls to the chainlink price oracle. If a user adds too many markets, these two functions, which are critical in borrowing, redeeming, and liquidating, may cause out of gas errors.

A malicious user can use this to their advantage by adding markets, taking out large loans and not have the chance of being liquidated because when `isLiquidatable()` checks an account's collateralization, it will run out of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary
## Impact
Liquidations may not be possible because when calculating if a user is under-collateralized, because the for loop in `isLiquidatable()` will run out of gas.

## Recommendation
Consider limiting the amount of markets a user can enter at one time.
