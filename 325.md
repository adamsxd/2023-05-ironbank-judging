# If a token's oracle goes down or price falls to zero, all liquidations, redemptions, and borrowing will be frozen if the user has entered that token market

## Summary
In some extreme cases, oracles can be taken offline or token prices can fall to zero. In these cases, liquidations will be frozen (all calls will revert) for any debt holders holding this token, even though they may be some of the most important times to allow liquidations to retain the solvency of the protocol.

Furthermore, if a user has entered that token's market, all calls such as `redeem` & `borrow` will also revert no matter which token it is being called with. This is because `_getAccountLiquidity` iterates through every market the user is participating in to check the account's total liquidity, will eventually revert when it reaches the failing feed, effectively bricking the entire a lot of the functionality of the protocol for any user entered in that token market. If the feed goes down for a popular asset that many users are participating in, this can cause a massive DOS. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink has taken oracles offline in extreme cases. For example, during the UST collapse, Chainlink paused the UST/ETH price oracle, to ensure that it wasn't providing inaccurate data to protocols.

## Impact
```solidity
    function _isLiquidatable(address user) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 liquidationCollateralValue;
        uint256 debtValue;

        address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
            if (!m.config.isListed) {
                continue;
            }

            uint256 supplyBalance = m.userSupplies[user];
            uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, user);

            uint256 assetPrice = PriceOracleInterface(priceOracle).getPrice(
                userEnteredMarkets[i]
            );
```

```solidity
    function _getAccountLiquidity(
        address user
    ) internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 collateralValue;
        uint256 debtValue;

        address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
            DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[userEnteredMarkets[i]];
            if (!m.config.isListed) {
                continue;
            }

            uint256 supplyBalance = m.userSupplies[user];
            uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, user);

            uint256 assetPrice = PriceOracleInterface(priceOracle).getPrice(
                userEnteredMarkets[i]
            );
```

Both `_isLiquidatable` &  `_getAccountLiquidity` use a for loop to iterate through all of the user's debt and balance, which will cause a revert, allowing the user to not be liquidated for any of his positions. Additionally, these calls are also used in `redeem` and `borrow`, so user's will not be able to call either of those functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a `try/catch` in the `getPriceFromChainlink` to be able to handle this revert, such as adding a backup oracle in the case that the Chainlink oracle goes down.
