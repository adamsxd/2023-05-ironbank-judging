# Extra review process should be placed on the Borrower Smart Contract.

## Summary
In Ironbank the borrower has to be a smart contract and to be able to borrow loans it has to be reviewed by the Ironbank Team, which verifies the code in the address after that the contract is authorized to certain actions in the iron bank protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
However, mere reviewing and verification of a smart contract aren't enough, because with the use of Create2 and Create opCode hackers can change the code on a particular address, and it could be used to exploit bugs newly found, A good example of the is the [TONARDO CASH GOVERNANCE HACK](https://youtu.be/whjRc4H-rAc) where the hack deployed a contract and after review, the developers verified and authorized the contract, thinking it couldn't execute any malicious code, but the hacker destroyed the contract and re-created a new contract but with the same address, which was earlier described and after that it exploits a bug on their protocol, leading to taking up to 60% above of its Governance. 
## Impact
If a malicious code is created in a smart contract it could be used to exploit the Protocol, and The Developers would be unaware of this kind of hack.

## Recommendation
here there wasn't really much the developers and the team could do but to have taken extra steps to always review and re-check the code in a contract, however, some good checks would be to check:
- Check for a self-destruct function in contracts that you're reviewing.
- Ensure you check every external call and the addresses that those calls are made to as to be free from a [honey pot](https://youtu.be/d0q5zVnNLWs) attack, Always be on the edge for hidden [malicious code](https://youtu.be/qDYlauM00lY).
- Always be on watch, for this kind of attack and look for better ways to mitigate such issues.
