# Missing sequencer check for ARB network in `PriceOracle.sol`

## Summary
When using Chainlink in L2 (Arbitrum in this case), it requires a check on the up/downtime of the sequencer due to the fact that it could return incorrect (not fresh) prices although looking like it did.
## Vulnerability Detail
See above. This could happen if there's an error in the sequencer (like the gas issue of past week) or the team took it down
## Impact
Incorrect collateral calculation when checking for account health at several functions. 
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
How to implement a check for this is explained here: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code
