# Lack of checking for stale price data from chainlink oracles can potentially lead to incorrect prices

## Summary

When retrieving the price data from the chainlink oracle price registry, there is no check as to whether the price data is stale, which can lead to invalid prices for assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getPriceFromChainlink` function of the PriceOracle contract does not check whether the retrieved price for the base,quote oracle is stale, which can lead to stale prices being accepted for an asset. There is only a check as to whether the price is greater than 0:
```solidity
(, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
require(price > 0, "invalid price");
```

## Impact

Not checking whether the price data from the chainlink oracles is stale can result in the wrong price being returned, which can break the functionality of the protocol.

## Recommendation

Add checks for determining if the price data is stale:
```solidity
(uint80 roundId,int256 price,,uint256 updatedAt,uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
require(price > 0, "invalid price");

require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < PRICE_ORACLE_STALE_THRESHOLD);
require(answeredInRound >= roundId);
```
