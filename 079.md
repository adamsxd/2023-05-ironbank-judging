# borrower can DOS liquidation.

## Summary
Liquidation calls can be frontrun and reverted, since it requires a specific amount to be passed. This can be used buy extra time by denying complete liquidations continuously, essentially creating a DOS attack.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function liquidate takes the parameter amount which is used to determine how much of the collateral needs to be liquidated. The calculation done in the function `_repay` which also has a require statement
`require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");`.
Let's say the liquidator chooses to pay the full borrow balance and calls `liquidate` with the full borrow balance.
the borrower can frontrun the call, and call  `repay` to pay as little as one wei and have the call to liquidate reverted.

## Impact
liquidation can be DOSed

## Code Snippet

```solidity
require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
the check in _repay can be removed and replaced with:
```diff
uint256 borrowBalance = _getBorrowBalance(m, to);
-        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
+        if (amount > borrowBalance) {
            amount = borrowBalance;
        }
-	require(amount <= borrowBalance, "repay too much");
```
