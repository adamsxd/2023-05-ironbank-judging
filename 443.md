# inIncorrect  Normalization of Prices for Tokens with More Than 18 Decimals

## Summary
The getNormalizedPrice function in the codebase has a potential bug when dealing with tokens that have more than 18 decimal places.
 The bug arises from the assumption that the maximum number of decimals for each token is 18, which may not hold true for tokens with a higher number of decimal places. 
This can result in incorrect normalization of prices and subsequent impacts within the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
The bug stems from the expression 10 ** (18 - decimals) used for price normalization. 
While the function assumes a maximum of 18 decimals, this can cause inconsistencies, inaccurate calculations, and potential financial losses when dealing with tokens with more than 18 decimal places.

## Impact
Incorrect calculations: The bug can lead to inaccurate financial calculations and incorrect comparisons, affecting system behavior.
Data inconsistency: Normalized price discrepancies may occur, causing confusion and incorrect information.
Financial losses: Inaccurate prices can result in incorrect transactions and financial losses.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L82

    function getNormalizedPrice(uint256 price, address asset) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(asset).decimals();
        return price * 10 ** (18 - decimals);
    }

## Recommendation
Modify the normalization calculation logic to handle tokens with varying decimal places accurately. 
Consider using conditional statements or external libraries to perform precise arithmetic calculations.
