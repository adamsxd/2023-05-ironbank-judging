# User can prevent liquidations by frontrunning the tx and slightly increasing their collateral

## Summary
User can prevent liquidations by frontrunning the tx and decreasing their debt so that the liquidation transaction reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the liquidation transaction, the caller has to specify the amount of debt they want to liquidate, `repayAmount`. The maximum value for that parameter is the total amount of debt the user holds. Usually when an user is liquidatable, the liquidator will try to put `repayAmount` equal to total amount of debt the user holds.
However, in the repay process, the contract will check `repayAmount` to be less than or equal to user's total amount of debt.
User can front run this transaction and repay 1 wei of asset to put `repayAmount` bigger than total debt 1 wei. Therefore the liquidate transaction will revert.
## Impact
User can prevent liquidations by slightly modifying their position without putting it at a healthy state.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the liquidator trying to repay more than total debt, the contract should continue to let the liquidator pay the whole debt instead of reverting the transaction
