# Can't unpause a listed PToken market

## Summary
Can't unpause a listed PToken market

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a Ptoken market is listed, the **config.setBorrowed** value is set to **true** to prevent borrowing. After that the owner or a guardian can unpause the current market but the problem is that the **setMarketBorrowPaused** function doesn't allow any changes to be made for a PToken market.

## Impact
Borrowing for PToken markets will be frozen forever.
