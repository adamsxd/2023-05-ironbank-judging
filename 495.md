# interestRateModelAddress is not checked during listMarket() in MarketConfigurator.sol

## Summary
No check on `interestRateModelAddress` to confirm it is not 0 address.

## Vulnerability Detail
If admin accidently input 0 address for `interestRateModelAddress` while setting config using `listMarket` function, interest rate will not be working correctly and affect everything that rely on `interestRateModelAddress`.

## Impact
Everything that rely on `interestRateModelAddress` will not work properly.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
Add check such as `require(interestRateModelAddress != address(0))` to avoid possible vulnability.
