# IronBank exchange rate is susceptible to significant manipulation due to the calculation method on the `_getExchangeRate` function

## Summary

IronBank exchange rate is susceptible to significant manipulation due to the calculation method on the `_getExchangeRate` function

## Vulnerability Detail

The IronBank use `totalSupply`, `totalReserves`, `totalCash`, and `totalBorrow` to determine the exchange rate of IBToken. Those values can easily be manipulated, especially the `totalSupply` and `totalCash`, leaving it susceptible to a flash loan attack.

This allows a user to take a flash loan and arbitrarily increase the protocol's view of the Exchange Rate of IBToken value during a transaction, which allows them to sandwich attack, avoid liquidations or steal market cash.

When an asset's price is derived from a spot price, there exists a vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the spot price using a flash-loan sandwich attack. This manipulation can have adverse effects on the accuracy and integrity of the asset's derived price, potentially leading to exploitative actions by the attacker. So someone can just flash-loan (from AAVE, for example) and call `supply()` to increase `totalCash` and `totalSupply` which then directly impacting the Exchange Rate.

From https://blog.alphaventuredao.io/fair-lp-token-pricing/ describe clearly about this price manipulation, which involve a flash loan sandwich attacl as follow:

> A flash-loan sandwich attack involves 3 steps:
>
> 1. Flash loan and pump the underlying asset to the pool (temporarily faking reserve balances)
> 2. Attack the target protocol (getting false reserve balances)
> 3. Dump the asset back and return the borrowed asset.

By doing some other modification of this issue, it can be used to preventing liquidation (eq. inflate price and front-run the liquidation trx), and drain market cash in IronBank pool.

## Impact

Exchange rate can be manipulated to cause loss of funds for the protocol and other users.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L805-L811

```js
File: IronBank.sol
805:     function _getExchangeRate(DataTypes.Market storage m) internal view returns (uint256) {
806:         uint256 totalSupplyPlusReserves = m.totalSupply + m.totalReserves;
807:         if (totalSupplyPlusReserves == 0) {
808:             return m.config.initialExchangeRate;
809:         }
810:         return ((m.totalCash + m.totalBorrow) * 1e18) / totalSupplyPlusReserves;
811:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This issue is quite wellknown in AMM. Therefore we can adjust the logic in the `_getExchangeRate()` formula to match the code in the other AMM oracles, properly implementing the Fair Pricing formula and ensuring protection against flash loans.
