# Ironbank#Repay can be front run when uint256.max is used

## Summary
The repay function within Ironbank.sol lets users repay their tokens borrowed. It's possible to repay for someone else and set the amount to uint256.max to indicate to pay the total loan back. This can be front run by the beneficiary to abuse the initiator. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`_repay` is called from `repay` like this:
```solidity
_repay(m, from, to, market, amount)
```
It's possible to repay on behalf of someone else by supplying a different 'to' than 'from', it's also possible for `to`, which will be the sender (see: `isAuthorized` modifier) to indicate to repay the full amount by passing `uint256.max` as the amount.
However 'to' can monitor that and front run the transaction by borrowing more. It's understandable why the `uint256.max` option is there since the amount passed won't be accounting for the interest accrued. To not leave dust uint256.max can be used. However, this opens up a vulnerability where this can be front run. 
For example:
User A supplies and borrows from market Z amount 100.
User B wants to repay user A and passes in uint256.max
User A front runs and borrows more until the maximum allowance/amount user B has

## Impact
When repaying on behalf of someone else this can be front run by the receiver and borrow more tokens and get them immediately from the initiator.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow uint256.max if to == from in repay. See this validation and explanation from [Aave](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/issues/221)
