# anyone can supply dust for another user on all markets to increase another user's gas cost for executing liquidity check

## Summary
anyone can supply dust for another user on all markets to increase another user's gas cost for executing liquidity check

## Vulnerability Detail
On IronBank, anyone can supply 1wei for another users across all markets to make another user "enter market". After entering market the attacked user would have to loop through the list of allEnteredMarkets during `borrow`, `redeem` and `transferIBToken`, all of which would rely on `_checkAccountLiquidity` to ensure proper collaterialization.

```solidity
    function supply(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        isAuthorized(from)
    {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
        require(!m.config.isSupplyPaused(), "supply paused");
        require(!isCreditAccount(to), "cannot supply to credit account");

        _accrueInterest(market, m);

        if (m.config.supplyCap != 0) {
            uint256 totalSupplyUnderlying = m.totalSupply * _getExchangeRate(m) / 1e18;
            require(totalSupplyUnderlying + amount <= m.config.supplyCap, "supply cap reached");
        }

        uint256 ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);

        // Update storage.
        m.totalCash += amount;
        m.totalSupply += ibTokenAmount;
        unchecked {
            // Overflow not possible: supplyBalance + ibTokenAmount is at most totalSupply + ibTokenAmount, which is checked above.
            m.userSupplies[to] += ibTokenAmount;
        }

        // Enter the market.
        if (amount > 0) {
            _enterMarket(market, to);
        }
```

_enterMarket
```solidity
    function _enterMarket(address market, address user) internal {
        if (enteredMarkets[user][market]) {
            // Skip if user has entered the market.
            return;
        }

        enteredMarkets[user][market] = true;
        allEnteredMarkets[user].push(market);

        emit MarketEntered(market, user);
    }
```
## Impact
increased gas cost for attacked user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement a delegate check before allowing another user to enter markets for someone.
