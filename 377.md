# FlashLoan can be fail if token is USDT

## Summary
Because the USDT token has a mechanism that requires the allowances to be equal to zero, the flash loan can fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
The first time IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max); is executed, it will succeed because the allowance is zero. However,in the second time  that  the allowance is less than the amount, it will fail the  because the allowance is not zero.

            IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
        }
