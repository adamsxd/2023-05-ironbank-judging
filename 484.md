# `PToken.absorb` should have access control.

## Summary

`PToken.absorb(user)` can mint the token to `user`. It absorbs the surplus underlying asset to the user. According to the comment, `PToken.absorb` should only be called by contracts, but there is no access control on the function.

>      * @dev This function should only be called by contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

`PToken.absorb` is a public function without any access control. Anyone can call `absorb` to get the surplus.
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Absorb the surplus underlying asset to user.
     * @dev This function should only be called by contracts.
     * @param user The beneficiary to absorb the surplus underlying asset
     */
    function absorb(address user) public {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 amount = balance - totalSupply();
        _mint(user, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

Unauthorized users can call `absorb` to take the surplus.
