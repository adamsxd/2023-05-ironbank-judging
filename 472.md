# No checks if an Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down

## Summary
Since Iron Bank is going to be uploaded on Arbitrum, it must be checked if the sequencer is down to avoid 
stale prices. Because of this a malicious user can take advantage of the sequencer's downtime.

## Vulnerability Detail
Only checking the price is not enough to ensure that prices are not stale
