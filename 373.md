# Lenders can withdraw all tokens through a repetitive withdraws

## Summary

When a lender redeems their ibTokens for the underlying asset, they can define how much of the underlying asset they want to receive. IronBank then takes this amount and calculates the amount of ibTokens the lender loses in exchange for the underlying asset. Unfortunately the formula may result in a zero return value, thus causing the lender to never lose any ibTokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside the `IronBank#redeem` function, the amount of ibTokens the user must exchange for the underlying assets is based on the following formula:

```solidity
ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);
```

If the exchange rate ever exceeds an amount above the numerator, the ibTokenAmount will equal zero.

An example of this can be found in this code sample below:

```solidity
// AUDIT: if an amount is small enough, ibTokenAmount is zero. however this will allow a user
// to withdraw an amount even though they don't own any ibTokens.
/* 

  By providing a small enough amount, ibTokenAmount can result in being zero if the exchange rate
  is large enough. This will result in a user redeeming a small amount of funds in exchange for never having to sacrifice any ibTokens.

  The protocol should add a require check that if the ibTokenAmount is zero and the amount is larger than 0, the protocol should revert.

  uint mtotalSupply = 100e18;
  uint exchangeRate = 200_000e18;
  uint amount = 1e5;

  uint mUserSuppliesFrom = 0;
  uint userSupply = 0; // m.userSupplies[from];
  uint mtotalCash = 0; // m.totalCash;
  uint totalCash = mtotalCash;
  
  uint ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / exchangeRate;

  // Update storage.
  unchecked {
      mUserSuppliesFrom = userSupply - ibTokenAmount;
      mtotalCash = totalCash - amount;
      // Underflow not possible: ibTokenAmount <= userSupply <= totalSupply.
      mtotalSupply -= ibTokenAmount;
  }

  // whatever amount is will be transferred to user
  console.log(amount); // returns 100000
  console.log(ibTokenAmount); // returns 0

*/

```

The relevant code can be found [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L399-L451).

## Impact

Lenders can slowly withdraw tokens from the IronBank contract without having to lose ibTokens.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Redeem an amount of asset from Iron Bank.
     * @param from The address which will redeem the asset
     * @param to The address which will receive the token
     * @param market The address of the market
     * @param amount The amount of asset to redeem, or type(uint256).max for max
     */
    function redeem(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        isAuthorized(from)
    {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        _accrueInterest(market, m);

        uint256 userSupply = m.userSupplies[from];
        uint256 totalCash = m.totalCash;

        uint256 ibTokenAmount;
        bool isRedeemFull;
        if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
            ibTokenAmount = userSupply;
            amount = (ibTokenAmount * _getExchangeRate(m)) / 1e18;
            isRedeemFull = true;
        } else {
            // This can return zero if the exchange rate is high enough
            ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);
        }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be a check that ensures that the ibTokenAmount is never zero if the amount is also zero. Compound does this via a [redeemVerify](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L322-L331) function that is called at the end of a lender's redemption.
