# Missing checks for active sequencer in L2s oracle

## Summary

Missing checks for active sequencer in L2s oracle.

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to Chainlink documentation contracts that use its functionality on L2s should check the sequencer state each time requesting prices. In another case could situation when the sequencer is down but oracle continues to consume outdated prices.

## Impact

If the L2s sequencer would not work, the protocol could still consume stale prices from Chainlink.

## Recommendation

Consider adding checks for L2 instances, accordingly to Chainlink documentation:
