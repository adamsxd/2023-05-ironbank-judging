# Market accounting can be broken after delisting and listing it again

## Summary

Market accounting can be broken after delisting and listing it again.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the market configurator delists a market the market struct is deleted from the `markets` mapping. However, the mappings in the struct [are not cleared](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/security-considerations.html#clearing-mappings).

This means that if the market is listed again, the market struct will contain the old values in the `userBorrows` and `userSupplies` mappings, while `totalCash`, `totalBorrow` and `totalSupply` will be zero.

## Impact

The market accounting will be broken, which can lead to many potential issues. One example might be the following case:
- Alice has a borrow balance of 10 USDC and the market is delisted.
- The market is listed again and Alice repays the 5 USDC.
- In the  `_repay` internal function the calculation for the `totalBorrow` amount will underflow, which will result in the amount `type(uint256).max - 5e6`.
```solidity
988    unchecked {
989        newUserBorrowBalance = borrowBalance - amount;
990        // Underflow not possible: amount <= userBorrow <= totalBorrow
991        newTotalBorrow = m.totalBorrow - amount;
992    }
```
- Alice supplies 1 USDC, which not will be overvalued, as the [exchange rate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L810) will be:
```solidity
((m.totalCash + m.totalBorrow) * 1e18) / totalSupplyPlusReserves = (1e6 + (type(uint256).max - 5e6)) * 1e18 / 1e6;
```
- Bob supplies 1000 USDC, but does not receive ibTokens, as the calculation will round to zero:
```solidity
323     uint256 ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);
```

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

A possible solution is that instead of deleting the market struct, the market configurator should set the `isListed` flag to false.
