# re-listing a market will break internal accounting

## Summary
When a market is re-listed not all of its properties are reset to the zero value. That causes internal accounting to break.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a struct is deleted, the mappings inside of it are not. That's because it doesn't know all the keys for which there's a value in the mapping.

If a market is delisted, the values inside the mappings, `userBorrows` & `userSupplies`, remain unchanged. When the market is listed again, these values still persist which breaks the internal accounting, e.g. `totalBorrows` will be 0 while there are a number of users who the system thinks are still active borrowers. That will break the exchange rate as well as some of the invariants.

For example, the following `unchecked` block could overflow because `userSupplies > totalSupply`:
```sol
        uint256 ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);

        // Update storage.
        m.totalCash += amount;
        m.totalSupply += ibTokenAmount;
        unchecked {
            // Overflow not possible: supplyBalance + ibTokenAmount is at most totalSupply + ibTokenAmount, which is checked above.
            m.userSupplies[to] += ibTokenAmount;
        }
```

Here's a simple PoC:

```sol
// TestMarketConfigurator.t.sol
    function testRelisting() public {
        deal(address(market), address(this), 10e18);
        market.approve(address(ib), 10e18);
        ib.supply(address(this), address(this), address(market), 10e18);

        uint userSupply = ib.getIBTokenBalance(address(this), address(market));

        vm.startPrank(admin);
        configurator.softDelistMarket(address(market));
        configurator.adjustMarketCollateralFactor(address(market), 0);
        configurator.adjustMarketLiquidationThreshold(address(market), 0);
    
        assertEq(ib.getIBTokenBalance(address(this), address(market)), userSupply, "user supply did change");

    }

```

## Impact
Relisting a market is not really possible unless all the borrowers and suppliers clear their position before it is delisted.

## Recommendation
Hard delisting should only be allowed when `totalSupply == 0`
