# Attackers can front-run credit limit settings to spend amounts not intended by the setter

## Summary
ironbank has the ability for administrators to set credit limits for users.
Users can monitor this and use more credits than allowed.
## Vulnerability Detail
Ironbank's `setCreditLimit` updates the credit amount with `creditLimits[user][market] = credit`.
For example, initially set the credit amount at 50. The administrator tries to set this to 40. However, the user front-runs this operation, consuming 50 first and using 40 after the administrator has set it. In this way, 90 credits can be used. This is not the intention of the administrator who set it to 40.
## Impact
Unintended amount of funds is borrowed.
