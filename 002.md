# [INFORMATIONAL/GAS/UX] Use something like an iterable mapping for constant time removal of array elements

## Summary
The current implementation of deleteElement has a linearly increasing gas cost with the number of elements in the array,
it is ran by users in the `_exitMarket` function in `IronBank.sol` as well as a few other spots which are ran by privileged users

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can use something similar to an 'IterableMapping' to give the `deleteElement` operation a constant time runtime cost.

You would use a struct that holds the array as well as a `mapping(address element => uint256 index) indexOf`, this changes the assumptions to an extra sstore when appending or removing from the array, in order to remove the storage read loop, which can be quite expensive
