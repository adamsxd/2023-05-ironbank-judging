# `redeem` and `repay` functions cannot be paused

## Summary
In the event of an extraordinary market situation, an exploit encountered by the protocol, or a legal obligation imposed by the governing body, the protocol possesses the ability to temporarily halt lending, borrowing, and liquidate functions. However, it lacks the capability to temporarily pause `IronBank.redeem` and `IronBank.repay` functions

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions `IronBank.borrow`, `IronBank.supply`, and `IronBank.liquidate` can be paused by the owner (or guardian in some instances), but functions `IronBank.redeem` and `IronBank.repay` functions cannot be paused. This means that users still have the capability to redeem (take out funds) or repay (put in funds) when there is a need for pausing both of these functions.

Example where Aave V2 pauses withdrawing and repaying:
- https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L146
- https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L241

## Impact
Similar to the ability to pause lending, borrowing, and liquidate functionalities, there may arise a situation where the protocol needs to temporarily halt the functionality of fund outflow or inflow. However, even in such cases, users retain the ability to reduce their positions by utilizing the `IronBank.redeem` and `IronBank.repay` functions. The protocol lacks the capability to prevent the outflow and inflow of funds, even when it is required to do so.

But no such options for `redeem` and `repay`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add pause options for `redeem` and `repay` functions in `PauseFlags` library, which currently supports only `supply`, `borrow`, and `liquidate` pausing.
