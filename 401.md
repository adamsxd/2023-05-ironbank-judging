# Transfer fails in ERC20 with Revert on Large Transfers feature

## Summary
Some tokens (e.g. `UNI`, `COMP`) revert if the value passed to `transfer` is larger than `uint96`.
With such tokens, there is always the possibility that the transfer will fail and the funds will not be able to be transferred
## Vulnerability Detail
Functions with seize-type , which exist in some contracts, try to transfer all balances that the address has as `amount`.
If the balance exceeds `uint96`, the funds cannot be withdrawn.
## Impact
Funds Stuck in Contracts
