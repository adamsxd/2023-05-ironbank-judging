# No secondary price oracle and no check for L2 sequencer uptime feed and grace period

## Summary

Due to the way lending protocols work, price of an asset is extremely important. However relying on only one oracle can cause problems if the oracle goes down. Also the L2 sequencer could go offline causing problems for borrowers.

## Vulnerability Detail

If Chainlink oracle goes down the protocol does not have a second backup price oracle to fallback to.
If the L2 sequencer goes offline and after a while it goes back online, the oracle will update the price and all price movements that occurred during downtime are applied at once. If these movements are significant, they may cause chaos. Borrowers would rush to save their positions, while liquidators would rush to liquidate borrowers. Since liquidations are handled mainly by bots, borrowers are likely to suffer mass liquidations.

## Impact

This could cause a liquidation of certain users when they were not supposed to be liquidated.

## Recommendation

Consider [implementing circuit breakers](https://0xmacro.com/blog/how-to-consume-chainlink-price-feeds-safely/), an additional second price oracle, either Uniswap TWAP or another off-chain oracle like Tellor. And correctly implement the L2 sequencer. All recommendations can be found in the link provided.
