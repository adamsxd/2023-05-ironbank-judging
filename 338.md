# Bad debts accrual if a borrowers account is so underwater.

## Summary

Even if liquidations are triggered in time it is possible that the price of an asset  falls too much that it becomes unprofitable for liquidators to liquidate the account of the borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail

 Given a scenario where  a borrower obtained a loan by providing collateral when an initial price of an asset, p1, valued at $1000. The collateral factor, set at 0.9, determined the maximum allowable debt at $900. Under normal circumstances, if the price of the collateral (p2) falls within the range of $900 to $1000, liquidators have the opportunity to liquidate the account and generate a profit. However, when the price (p2) drops below the $900 threshold, for instance, reaching $880, liquidators are unable to derive any benefit from liquidating the account. Consequently, the account is left in an unfavorable state, where the debt continues to accumulate interest without a viable solution for repayment. This can be worse if many accounts reach this state.

## Impact
The project may be left in a situation where there are many bad debts which accrue interests and cannot be repaid.
