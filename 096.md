# If a user once becomes a credit account, they can no longer be a non-credit account.

## Summary
When removed all credit limits, accounts are supposed to become non-credit once again. However, due to the flaw in logic, once accounts become credit accounts, they can no longer be regular accounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
When checking if an account is Credit account or not, the following check is made: 
```solidity
function isCreditAccount(address user) public view returns (bool) {
        return allCreditMarkets[user].length > 0;
    }
```
`allCreditMarkets` is set in the `setCreditLimit()`. When a user gets a credit limit > 0 for a market, said market is added to the array. When he gets his credit limit back to 0, said market is deleted. The problem is that when a market is deleted, the slot in the array isn't really deleted, but rather set to a value of 0 (in the case of addresses - 0x0 address). Meaning that once a user gets any creditLimit, `allCreditMarkets.length` becomes > 0 forever and cannot be lowered.  Even though the user is supposed to be a non-credit account, they are a credit account and are heavily limited by the functionalities of the protocol
```solidity
function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 credit) external onlyCreditLimitManager {
        DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
        require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

        if (credit == 0 && creditLimits[user][market] != 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].deleteElement(market);
        } else if (credit != 0 && creditLimits[user][market] == 0) {
            allCreditMarkets[user].push(market);
        }

        creditLimits[user][market] = credit;
        emit CreditLimitChanged(user, market, credit);
    }
```
## Impact
Once a user becomes a credit account, they cannot get it removed and are a credit account forever.

Add different accounting for whether an account is a credit account or not.
