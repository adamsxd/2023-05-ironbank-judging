# Anyone can steal ETH in TxBuilderExtension contract that should be seized by the owner

## Summary
Anyone can steal ether from `TxBuilderExtension`. 
Note: ether can stack in the contract not just by accidentally send by user (see my other issue)

## Vulnerability Detail
If contract has X ether user can batch 11 ACTION_SUPPLY_NATIVE_TOKEN actions with msg.value = X/10. First action will use sended funds, but in next actins contract funds will be supplied to user account.
