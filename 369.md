# Utilization rate incorrectly includes reserves in calculations

## Summary

The TripleSlopeRateModel utilization rate calculates the percentage of funds currently being borrowed in IronBank. This utilization rate relies on the following formula:

```solidity
return (borrow * 1e18) / (cash + borrow);
```

By not subtracting the reserves from the denominator, IronBank is generating a higher utilization rate than if reserves was subtracted. In cases when the total borrow is low and the reserves have not been drained in awhile, the utilization rate may be higher than normal.

## Vulnerability Detail

The TripleSlopeRateModel utilization rate is calculated by `borrow / (cash + borrow)`. This does not take into consideration that the borrow amount also contains the reserve, an unrealized percentage of funds that are reserved for IronBank.

In Compound V2, Compound [calculates the utilization rate](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/JumpRateModel.sol#LL69C58-L69C58) with:

```solidity
function utilizationRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves) public pure returns (uint) {
    // Utilization rate is 0 when there are no borrows
    if (borrows == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    return borrows * BASE / (cash + borrows - reserves);
}
```

See code [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/interest-rate-model/TripleSlopeRateModel.sol#L37-L42).



## Impact

If IronBank begins to accrue a large amount of reserves compared to the total borrows, then the utilization rate will be higher than it necessarily should. This can trigger a higher utilization rate than expected causing a higher borrow rate.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
return (borrow * 1e18) / (cash + borrow);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The utilization rate should subtract the reserves from the denominator. This will ensure that a correct utilization rate is returned. In addition, it will ensure that the utilization rate is not manipulated by actions such as withdrawing reserves.
