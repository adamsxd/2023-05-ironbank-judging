# DebtToken does not adhere to the ERC20 standard as a generic interface standard.

## Summary
Debt Token is derived from ERC20 interfaces, but does not support many of the core behaviours of ERC20 tokens. The implementation seems like a force fit and should be avoided. There are some functions like name, symbol, decimals, balanceOf and totalSupply which look back into a Storage contract on the underlying market.

Since the Debt Token is not ERC20, it would be more appropriate to add these function signatures to DebtTokenInterface and
implemented in the Debt Token Contract. This would eliminate the need to suppress some of the functions of a standard interface.
ERC20 is a generic standard used for composibility and hence protocol should use to provide composibility if intended. 

## Vulnerability Detail
DebtToken does not adhere to the standards of ERC20 and could break the norms of composibility. 

## Impact
Does not adhere to the standards of ERC20 and some of the behavior are not inline with how other protocols talk to each other.
With composibility as an important prespective, it is recommended to not break the standard. The implementation reverts on some of the standard functions of ERC20. As the intention is to leverage the existing functionality of ERC20, it is more appropriate to copy the standard code from Standard Library repos instead.

## Code Snippet
Also, it is not clear why the below line was added in some of the below functions.  
 ironBank = ironBank; // Shh

```solidity
function allowance(address, address) public view returns (uint256) {
        ironBank; // Shh
        revert("unsupported");
    }

    /* ========== MUTATIVE FUNCTIONS ========== */

    /// @dev Comply the standard ERC20 interface but disable the functionality.
    function approve(address, uint256) public returns (bool) {
        ironBank = ironBank; // Shh
        revert("unsupported");
    }

    /// @dev Comply the standard ERC20 interface but disable the functionality.
    function increaseAllowance(address, uint256) public returns (bool) {
        ironBank = ironBank; // Shh
        revert("unsupported");
    }

    /// @dev Comply the standard ERC20 interface but disable the functionality.
    function decreaseAllowance(address, uint256) public returns (bool) {
        ironBank = ironBank; // Shh
        revert("unsupported");
    }

    /// @dev Comply the standard ERC20 interface but disable the functionality.
    function transfer(address, uint256) public returns (bool) {
        ironBank = ironBank; // Shh
        revert("unsupported");
    }

    /// @dev Comply the standard ERC20 interface but disable the functionality.
    function transferFrom(address, address, uint256) public returns (bool) {
        ironBank = ironBank; // Shh
        revert("unsupported");
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
a) Dont derive the DebtTokenInterface from IERC20 and IERC20Metadata.
b) Instead, copy over the necessary function signatures from the above interfaces into DebtTokenInterface and implement them appropriately in the DebtToken Contract.
