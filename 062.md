# IBToken contract's implementation for some of functions is misleading.

## Summary
IBToken contract implements few functionalities that are like a force fit. The implementation does rely events to offchain with out any activity on chain. The Token contract derives from ERC20Upgradeable.

Example: 
a) mint 
b) burn
c) transfer

## Vulnerability Detail
Onchain and off chain synch up is based on events fired by the on chain so that Offchain can keep in sync. But, for some of the functions like listed above, there is no core transaction activity on chain while an event is being published for offchain to account the change.

## Impact
Offchain and Onchain does not keep in synch using these events, it defeats the purpose of the events being fired. 

## Code Snippet
Note the from account for event in Mint function to be Zero Address.

```solidity
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyIronBank {
        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Burn IBToken.
     * @dev This function will only emit a Transfer event.
     * @param account The address to burn IBToken from
     * @param amount The amount of IBToken to burn
     */
    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyIronBank {
        emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) If IBToken is a fungible Token, implement the ERC20 standard implementation
2) If IBToken is not a fungible token, then revisit and define the correct interface for the specific use case so that it is clearly not an ERC20 standard fungible token.
