## Vulnerability Detail
In PriceOracle.sol, it check price > 0, but it doesn't check for the stale price by updateAt and roundId.
## Impact
Price oracle could get a stale price without checking roundId.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check `price`, `updateAt` and `roundId`when getting price:
`(uint80 roundId, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(updatedAt > 0, "Round is not complete");
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");`
