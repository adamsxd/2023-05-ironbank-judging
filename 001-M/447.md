# Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` can return stale or incorrect result

## Summary

The function `getPriceFromChainlink()` inside the PriceOracle contract does make a call to the Chainlink `latestRoundData()` function but doesn't contain checks on round completeness and update timestamp, which could lead to returning a stale or wrong price and thus the protocol functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected and sometimes can lead to a loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue occurs in the `getPriceFromChainlink()` function below :

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

As you can see the function `getPriceFromChainlink()` calls the function `latestRoundData()` to get the prices of tokens using chainlink price feeds, but the function does not implement the required checks for verifying the round timestamp and completeness to avoid outdated results, this can lead to stale prices according to Chainlink's documentation.

The function `getPriceFromChainlink()` is used inside the function `getPrice()` which in turn is used by the IronBank contract to get the collateral value of the users and to check if they are liquidatable or not. So if the `getPriceFromChainlink()` returns a stale/wrong price this can potentially cause a loss of funds and will have a negative impact on the protocol :

- Some users will not be able to borrow when they are supposed to be able to.

- Some users will be set as liquidatable (or not liquidatable) when they are supposed to be solvent (not solvent).

## Impact

If the oracles may return stale/wrong prices which can result in false liquidation or over-borrowing in the IronBank contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the required checks whenever the `latestRoundData()` function is called, the function `getPriceFromChainlink()` should be updated as follows :

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint80 roundID, int256 price,uint256 timestamp, uint256 updatedAt,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // @audit Add the required checks
    require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
    require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
    require(
        block.timestamp - updatedAt <= 3600,
        "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
    );

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```
