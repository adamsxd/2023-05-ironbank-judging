# Oracle has no check for round completeness

## Summary

No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. The borrower could borrow assets beyond his limit with the wrong price.

## Vulnerability Detail

The price oracle does not check round completeness.

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

## Impact

The borrower could borrow assets beyond his limit with the wrong price and leave a bad debt.
