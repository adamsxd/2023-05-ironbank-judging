# Chainlink oracle data is not validated, could return unwanted price value.

## Summary

Necessary sanity checked against Chainlink price feeds data is not performed. The functions rely on this data may not work properly and process incorrect price value.

## Vulnerability Detail

`PriceOracle.sol` is calling chainlink registry's `latestRoundData()` to get the price of the token, but no necessary sanity checked ( timestamp and round completeness) is performed.

According to [Chainlink's documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data) :

1. this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or outdated stale price.
2. "A read can revert if the caller is requesting the details of a round that was invalid or has not yet been answered. If you are deriving a round ID without having observed it before, the round might not be complete. To check the round, validate that the timestamp on that round is not 0."
3. roundId and answeredInRound are also returned. “You can check answeredInRound against the current roundId. If answeredInRound is less than roundId, the answer is being carried over. If answeredInRound is equal to roundId, then the answer is fresh.”

## Impact

If there is a problem with chainlink (node problem, congestion or attack on system), checking the returned price at least greater than 0 is not enough, if oracle returned stale price, Iron Bank will process its calculation using wrong price value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the code to perform these check : 

```solidity
  (uint80 roundId, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
  require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "round is stale");
  require(updatedAt > 0, "round is incomplete");
  require(price > 0, "Invalid feed answer");
```
