# Chainlink's latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
Chainlink's latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact
The getPriceFromChainlink() and _setAggregators() function in the contract PriceOracle.sol fetches the asset price from a Chainlink aggregator using the latestRoundData function. However, there are no checks on roundID, resulting in stale prices. The oracle wrapper calls out to a chainlink oracle receiving the latestRoundData().

Stale prices could put funds at risk. According to Chainlink's documentation, This function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0, causing an incorrect price fed to the PriceOracle. The external Chainlink oracle, which provides index price information to the system, introduces risk inherent to any dependency on third-party data sources. For example, the oracle could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in outdated data being fed to the index price calculations. Oracle reliance has historically resulted in crippled on-chain systems, and complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as network congestion.

## Code Snippet

In PriceOracle.sol, getPriceFromChainlink() function is given as below,

```solidity
File: src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol

66    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
67        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
68        require(price > 0, "invalid price");
69
70        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
71        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
72    }
```

As seen above at L-67, the function has used latestRoundData() but it has no checks for stale price and the impact is explained above in detail.

In PriceOracle.sol, getPriceFromChainlink() function is given as below,

```solidity
File: src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol

97    function _setAggregators(Aggregator[] calldata aggrs) external onlyOwner {
98        uint256 length = aggrs.length;
99        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length;) {
100            if (aggrs[i].base != address(0)) {
101                require(aggrs[i].quote == Denominations.ETH || aggrs[i].quote == Denominations.USD, "unsupported quote");
102
103                // Make sure the aggregator works.
104                address aggregator = address(registry.getFeed(aggrs[i].base, aggrs[i].quote));
105                require(registry.isFeedEnabled(aggregator), "aggregator not enabled");
106
107                (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(aggrs[i].base, aggrs[i].quote);
108                require(price > 0, "invalid price");
109            }
110            aggregators[aggrs[i].asset] = AggregatorInfo({base: aggrs[i].base, quote: aggrs[i].quote});
111
112            unchecked {
113                i++;
114            }
```

As seen above at L-107, the function has used latestRoundData() but it has no checks for stale price and the impact is explained above in detail.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding missing checks for stale data.

For example:

```solidity

(uint80 roundID, int256 feedPrice, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = feed.latestRoundData();
require(feedPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); 
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```
