# Stale Price from Oracle

## Summary
The ```registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);``` returns 5 parameters 

 ```solidity
 (   uint80 roundID,  int price,  uint startedAt ,   uint updatedAT , uint80 answeredInRound  )

```
But only the price is checked if it is greater than zero. the updatedAT variable returned from the oracle is supposed to be checked against the current block.timestamp as well as a validity period. This would prevent stale data from being used if the validity period has elapsed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Below is the ```getPriceFromChainlink``` function where this bug is present

 ```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```
## Impact
Stale Prices can be used when borrowing, repaying, or even during liquidations, causing early liquidations or users benefitting more from stale prices being used. 
It can also be used during a flash loan attack for arbitrage.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check Prices against a validity period, for example 
``` solidity
uint256 public STALE_PRICE_CHECK = 7200   //2 hours requirement

function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,uint256 updatedAT,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");
     if(updatedAT < block.timeStamp +  STALE_PRICE_CHECK {
        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
else{
...............}
