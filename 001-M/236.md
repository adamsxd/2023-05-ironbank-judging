# Possibility of Stale Data Usage in the PriceOracle Contract


## Summary

The PriceOracle contract retrieves prices for a variety of assets through the Chainlink oracle system. It uses the Chainlink feed registry for asset price data. However, the contract does not perform a check for the freshness of the data, which means it could potentially use stale data if Chainlink fails to provide an update in a timely manner.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract's `getPrice()` and `_setAggregators()` methods both retrieve price data from Chainlink using the `registry.latestRoundData()` function. This function returns a tuple that includes the price and timestamp among other things, but the contract only uses the price and ignores the timestamp. As a result, the contract has no mechanism for verifying that the price data is recent.

This is particularly noticeable in the [getPriceFromChainlink()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/9ebf1702b2163b55479624794ab7999392367d2a/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L36-L72) function:

```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```

The above snippet shows the usage of `registry.latestRoundData()`, but the timestamp field from the function call is ignored, resulting in a lack of staleness check on the received price data.

## Impact

The absence of a staleness check means that potentially outdated prices could be used for financial calculations and transactions. This can lead to incorrect valuation of user positions, unfair trades, and in severe cases, improper liquidations. The effects can be detrimental to both individual users and the overall integrity of the platform.

Manual Code Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, we recommend adding a staleness check for the received price data. This could be implemented as a configurable threshold parameter that defines the maximum allowed age of the data. If the timestamp of the received data is older than the current time minus this threshold, the contract should reject the data as stale and potentially fetch new data or revert the transaction. This will ensure that only fresh and accurate price data is used for calculations and transactions.
