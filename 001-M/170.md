# Price Oracle Data Freshness Not Checked, Stale Price Might be Used to Price Borrow and Liquidate

## Summary
In PriceOracle.sol `getPrice()`,  chainlink aggregator price feeds are fetched. However, there is no check on freshness of the data, making oracle vulnerable to stale price reporting.
## Vulnerability Detail
In PriceOracle.sol `getPrice()`, `getPriceFromChainlink()` is called which then calls chainlink price feed registry `latestRoundata()`. However, only zero price is checked from the return variables. This means that outdated price or stale price could have been accepted by the protocol.
```solidity
    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
>>>>        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```
## Impact
Chainlink could return stale price or outdated price that would be accepted by the protocol, allowing users to borrow more or liquidating users who shouldn't be liquidated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following checks.
```solidity
        (uint80 roundId, int256 price, ,uint256 updatedAt ,uint80 answeredInRound ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");
        require(answeredInRound>=roundID, "stale price" );
```
