# Lack of checks to avoid stale prices from Chainlink oracle

## Summary

`getPriceFromChainlink` function is not checking the returned values of Chainlink Registry to ensure the prices are fresh and not stale.

## Vulnerability Detail

When getting prices from Chainlink oracles, it's necessary to ensure the prices are fresh and not stale, and `getPriceFromChainlink` function from `PriceOracle` contract is not checking that. 

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Get price from Chainlink.
 * @param base The base asset
 * @param quote The quote asset
 * @return The price
 */
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price"); // @audit No checks for stale prices

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

Every Chainlink price feed has a different heartbeat, meaning it has to be updated every `x` amount of seconds depending on the feed, here some examples:

When getting prices from feeds, we have to ensure that the answer given by the oracle is fresh, meaning the answer given hasn't been updated more than a certain time ago. For ETH/USD oracle, the heartbeat is of 3600 seconds, meaning the oracle must be updated at least every 1 hour.

## Impact

If the Chainlink oracle is returning stale prices, the protocol will use the wrong values to make decisions so it could lead to false liquidations or over-borrowing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended to check `updatedAt` value returned from Chainlink against some `maxDelayTime` value set in the contract depending of the feed used. 

Example:
```diff
    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");
+       if(updatedAt < block.timestamp - maxDelayTime) revert(); // @audit Ensuring fresh prices

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```
