# Setting `liquidationThreshold` x `liquidationBonus` to 100% can result in bed debt for the bank when prices decrease fast

## Summary
When setting the `liquidationBonus` and the `liquidationTreshhold` it is checked if the product of both is <= 100%. If both values are set to be 100% or close to 100% this can result in bed debt for the bank if the price of the collateral starts falling fast like seen in previous market crashes.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `liquidationTreshhold` determines what percentage of the current collateral value the users debt must reach so the user is liquidatable. The `liquidationBonus` determines how much more value in collateral the liquidator gets when repaying the liquidated debt.

Example:
Bob has borrowed 80 USD and his collateral is currently worth 100 USD. Since the `liquidationThreshold` of the collateral market is 80% he can be liquidated. If the liquidation bonus is 125% the liquidator gets 125% of the repaid credit as collateral. This means if Alice repays Bobs debt of 80 USD, she will get 80 USD *125% = 100 USD worth of collateral. 

If the underlying for the above-described market loses value to fast, like seen in recent market crashes,  there will not be enough time to liquidate the markets positions when they hit the 80% `liquidationThreshold`. If the value of the underlying falls below the `liquidationThreshhold`, liquidators will only repay part of the debt to get 100% of the collateral. The rest of the debt turns into bad debt since there is no collateral to back it anymore. 
E.g the value of the collateral is now only 90USD. To get 100% of the collateral, Alice only need to repay 90 USD / 125% = 72 USD. She gets all the collateral and the bank is stuck with 8 USD of bad debt.      



## Impact

If the impacted market has big volume the bank will get stucked with a lot of bad debt

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid such a risky exposure I would recommend to reduce `AX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_X_BONUS` to  e.g. 95%. This way there is still some buffer in case of a market crash
