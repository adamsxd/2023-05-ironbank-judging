# PriceOracle#getPriceFromChainlink may return stale data

## Summary

getPriceFromChainlink make the registry.latestRoundData subcall but only validates the price. It doesn't validate when price was last updated. Chainlink oracle have a built in heartbeat and data that has been updated outside of this window is stale and cannot be trusted.

## Vulnerability Detail

[PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72)

    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }

The above lines never validate when the price was last updated allowing for it to use stale data. Using outdated price data can lead to over borrowing or unfair liquidation.

## Impact

Contract can consume outdated information leading to incorrect prices

## Recommendation

Validate the update time to make sure it is within the heartbeat period.
