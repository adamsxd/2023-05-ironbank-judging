# The user's liquidation and supply should be paused simultaneously.

## Summary
When a market initiates liquidation on a user, if their supply is paused at that moment, it can lead to a situation where the user is unable to replenish their position. As a result, their position may be forcefully liquidated, resulting in loss of assets for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling the "liquidate" function, it may not check whether the market's supply is paused. It typically focuses on assessing the health of the user's position, specifically whether the value of the collateral is greater than the borrowed assets.

## Impact
As a result, their position may be forcefully liquidated, resulting in loss of assets for the user.

```solidity
 function liquidate(
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        address marketBorrow,
        address marketCollateral,
        uint256 repayAmount
    ) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(liquidator) {
        DataTypes.Market storage mBorrow = markets[marketBorrow];
        DataTypes.Market storage mCollateral = markets[marketCollateral];
        require(mBorrow.config.isListed, "borrow market not listed");
        require(mCollateral.config.isListed, "collateral market not listed");
        require(
            isMarketSeizable(mCollateral),
            "collateral market cannot be seized"
        );
        require(!isCreditAccount(borrower), "cannot liquidate credit account");
        require(liquidator != borrower, "cannot self liquidate");

        _accrueInterest(marketBorrow, mBorrow);
        _accrueInterest(marketCollateral, mCollateral);

        // Check if the borrower is actually liquidatable.
        require(_isLiquidatable(borrower), "borrower not liquidatable");
       // @audit-issue may not check whether the market's supply
