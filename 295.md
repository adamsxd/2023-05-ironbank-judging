# Interest rate is increasing over time depending on how often `_accrueInterest` is called

## Summary
Setting the borrowPerSecond1, borrowPerSecond2 and borrowPerSecond3 variables in the TrippleSlopeModel has the goal to have fixed interest rate depending on the the utilisation of the supply of the market. E.g the base rate is 1% per year, the kink1 is 50% and the borrowPerSecond1 rate is 1% per year. For a utilisation of 25% the users would expect to pay 1,5% interest. Depending on the number of times the function `_accrueInterest` is called e.g. when a user calls `supply()`, `borrow()` or `redeem()`the interest rate increases.

## Vulnerability Detail

Every time the function `_accrueInterest` is called the borrowIndex of the market is updated. The problem is, that the index is not increased by the `interestFactor` since the last call of `_accrueInterest` but by the product of the current `interestIndex` multiplies by the `interestFactor`.
`borrowIndex += (interestFactor * borrowIndex) / 1e18` resulting in a compounding interest effect
This leads to an increase of interest over time.

Example:

baseBorrowPerSecond = 1% per year
borrowPerSecond1 = 1% per year
kink1 = 50%
borrowPerSecond2 = 1% per year
kink2 = 90% 
borrowPerSecond3 = 1% per year  

User borrows 100% of supply for one year, no one else interacts with the market for one year. User repays this credit after one year. Interest should be 1% + 1%+1%+1% = 4%.

Times ` accrueInterest ` is called per year =>  interest paid:

1 time 		=> 4,000% / per year
12 times 	=> 4,074% / per year
365 times	=> 4,081% / per year
365 x 10 times 	=> 4,918% / per year (every day for 10 years)
365 x 25 times 	=> 6,873 % / per year /every day for 25 years)


Copy this test into the file `TestAccountLiquidity.t.sol` and run it with different values for `timesCallingAccrueIntrestPerYear` and `numberOfYears`:
```solidity
function testAccruingIntrest() public {
        uint256 timesCallingAccrueIntrestPerYear = 1;
        uint256 numberOfYears = 25;
        uint256 market1SupplyAmount = 10_000 * (10 ** underlyingDecimals1);
        uint256 market2BorrowAmount = 100 * (10 ** underlyingDecimals2);
        uint256 startingBallanceToken2Foruser = IERC20(address(market2)).balanceOf(address(user));
                
        //admin supplies market2 so user has something to borrow
        vm.startPrank(admin);
            market2.approve(address(ib), market2BorrowAmount);
            ib.supply(admin, admin, address(market2), market2BorrowAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user);
        // user deposite token1 and borrows token2 
            market1.approve(address(ib), market1SupplyAmount);
            ib.supply(user, user, address(market1), market1SupplyAmount);
            ib.borrow(user, user, address(market2), market2BorrowAmount);

        // calling accrueInterest x times
            for (uint i = 0; i < timesCallingAccrueIntrestPerYear* numberOfYears; i++) {
                skip(60*60*24*365/timesCallingAccrueIntrestPerYear);
                ib.accrueInterest(address(market2));
            }

        // repay debt
            market2.approve(address(ib), UINT256_MAX);
            ib.repay(user, user, address(market2), UINT256_MAX);
            uint256 userToken2AfterRepay = IERC20(market2).balanceOf(address(user));
            uint256 intrestAmountPayed = startingBallanceToken2Foruser - userToken2AfterRepay;
            console.log("Intrest amount payed per year", intrestAmountPayed/numberOfYears);
        vm.stopPrank(); 
    }
```

  

## Impact

Users are paying more and more interest over time. This is accelerated every time  `_ accrueInterest` is called.

## Tool used

Foundry

## Recommendation
To remove the compounded interest effect, make the following adjustment:

Replace this:
           	`borrowIndex += (interestFactor * borrowIndex) / 1e18;`
With this:
                `borrowIndex += interestFactor;`
