# XDZIBEC- Unauthorized Contract Pausing in Pausable Contract

## Summary

The `_pause()` function in  Contract has a vulnerability that allows any account to pause the contract, even if they are not authorized. This can lead to a disruption in the contract's functionality and prevent legitimate users from interacting with it.

## Vulnerability Detail

 there is a vulnerability in `_pause()` function:

```SOLIDITY
    function _pause() internal virtual whenNotPaused {
        _paused = true;
        emit Paused(_msgSender());
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns to normal state.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - The contract must be paused.
     */
    function _unpause() internal virtual whenPaused {
        _paused = false;
        emit Unpaused(_msgSender());
    }
}
```

the function` _pause()` does not check if the `caller` is an authorized account. 
This means that any account could pause the contract, even if they are not authorized to do so. 
This  allow an attacker to prevent users from interacting with the contract.

## Impact

the bug in `_pause()` function could be exploited by an attacker  can lead to disrupt the functionality of the contract and prevent users from interacting with it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

modify the` _pause() ` function to include a check that only authorized accounts can pause the contract. This can be achieved by implementing access control mechanisms, such as utilizing the` Ownable` contract from `OpenZeppelin` or implementing a custom access control solution.
By implementing proper access controls, the contract can ensure that only authorized accounts have the ability to pause or `unpause` the contract, maintaining the integrity and usability of the system.
