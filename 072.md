# User cannot exit market from reapy() because their supply has not been updated.

## Summary

The function `repay()` allows the user to exit the market if their supply is 0 and their borrowBalance is 0. Their borrow balance is updated in `reapy()` but their supply balance is not. Therefore the user will never be able to exit the market from `repay()`


## Vulnerability Detail

Let us examine the condition in `repay()` that allows the user to exit the market 

```solidity
        // Check if need to exit the market.
        if (m.userSupplies[to] == 0 && newUserBorrowBalance == 0) { 
            _exitMarket(market, to);
        }
```

Storage variables in this function update the users borrow balance here

```solidity

   uint256 newUserBorrowBalance;
        uint256 newTotalBorrow;
        unchecked {
            newUserBorrowBalance = borrowBalance - amount;
            // Underflow not possible: amount <= userBorrow <= totalBorrow
            newTotalBorrow = m.totalBorrow - amount;
        }

        // Update storage.
        m.userBorrows[to].borrowBalance = newUserBorrowBalance;

```

But the supply of the user is only updated in `redeem()`and not in `repay()`

```solidity
m.userSupplies[from] = userSupply - ibTokenAmount;
```

This means,  in order for the user to exit the market via `repay()` they would need to call `repay()` first (which will set their boroow balance to 0) then call `redeem()` (which would set their supply balance to 0) then call `repay()` again to exit.


The following is a sequence of events required for a user to exit the market from `repay()`

1. Bob calls `repay()` and repays their entire `borrowBalance` (m.userBorrows[to].borrowBalance is now 0) 
2. Bob then calls `redeem()` with  amount <  type(uint256).max (setting their supply to 0 )  `m.userSupplies[from] = userSupply - ibTokenAmount;`

(Note at this point they will not be able to exit the market from `redeem()` because  isRedeemFull = false;) -> a separate issue

3. Bob then calls `repay()` again to attempt to exit the market.

## Impact

User cannot exit the market from `repay()` code block is practically unreachable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the protocol would like the user to be able to automatically exit the market from the `repay()` function, check the user has redeemed their tokens. But this again is only possible if  collateralValue >= debtValue due to `_checkAccountLiquidity()` being called in `redeem()`->  the user can only exit the market if both their supply balance and borrow balance == 0

So the appropriate solution is to remove the ability for the user to exit the market from the `repay()` function. The user should only exit from `redeem()`
