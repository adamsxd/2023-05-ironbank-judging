# The Chainlink price feed's input is not properly validated

## Summary

Price Oracle's feed is not properly validated and it can use stale prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code in `PriceOracle::getPriceFromChainlink` uses a Chainlink price oracle in the following way:

```solidity
(, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
 require(price > 0, "invalid price");
```
This has some validation but it does not check if the answer (or price) received was actually a stale one. Reasons for a price feed to stop updating are listed [here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133242/how-future-resilient-is-a-chainlink-price-feed/133843#133843). Using a stale price in the application can result in wrong calculations in the vault shares math which can lead to an exploit from a bad actor.

## Impact

High, as it can result in the application working with an incorrect asset price. The likelihood is Low, as Chainlink oracles are mostly reliable, but there have been occurrences of this issue before.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the code in the following way:
```diff
- (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
+ (uint80 roundID, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt ,uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
 require(price > 0, "invalid price");
+ require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
 
+ if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - 60 * 60 /* 1 hour */) {
+     revert("stale oracle feed")
+ }
```

This way you will check for stale prices.
