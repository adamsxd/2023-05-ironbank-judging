# XDZIBEC-Vulnerability in the  Unauthorized Transfers function

## Summary

- The `_transfer` function does not check if the `caller` is the `Iron Bank`, which means that anyone can call this function and transfer `tokens` out of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc ERC20Upgradeable
    function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
    }
}
```
- The vulnerability is in the `_transfer` function is a internal function, which means that it can only be called by other functions in the contract. This function does not check if the caller is the Iron Bank, which means that anyone can call this function and transfer tokens out of the contract, an attacker could steal `token` from the contract if exploit this vulnerability

## Impact

- This vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal tokens from the contract.
