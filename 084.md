# IronBank._isLiquidatable and IronBank._getAccountLiquidity may run out of gas and revert due to the long list of markets.

## Summary
Both of those functions iterate over the array of arbitrary length which can potentially cause OOG errors.

## Vulnerability Detail
OOG error.

## Impact
```_getAccountLiquidity``` is called by an important ```_checkAccountLiquidity``` function as well as ```_isLiquidatable``` which is called by ```liquidate``` function. So protocol won't be able to work as intended if those function are to revert. There is no upper bound on the number of markets (except of course the number of markets supported by the protocol, which can be extended with time). Both of this functions write to storage in their loops, which is an expensive operation, and they both also make quite a lot of computation, so i would say that they are gas expensive.

There is an edge case where if there is enough markets for functions to revert, a malicious user can enter all of them, refuse to repay the debt, and liquidators won't be able to liquidate him since ```liquidate``` would revert.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Keep the number of markets low or adjust the function to be proccesable in several transactions.
