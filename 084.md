# Possible stale price values from Chainlink oracle

## Summary
No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated prices.

The functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, which sometimes can lead to fund loss.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `getPriceFromChainlink` in PriceOracle.sol does not check for round completeness.
```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
``` 
When getting latestRoundData, the only variable checked is the price.
However, according to [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values), answeredInRound should be checked to be == roundId

## Impact
latestRoundData() might return stale results leading to wrong prices and potential loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the check:
```solidity
        require(answeredInRound == roundID, "Stale price");
```
