# [M-2] Credit account can exceed credit limit without penalty

## Summary

A credit account allows a user, typically a contract, to borrow up to a credit limit without providing collateral. However, there is no mechanism to enforce the credit limit or to liquidate the credit account if it accrues interest beyond the limit.

## Vulnerability Detail

A credit account enables a user, typically a contract, to borrow up to the credit limit without providing collateral. 

        if (isCreditAccount(from)) {
            require(from == to, "credit account can only borrow to itself");
            require(creditLimits[from][market] >= newUserBorrowBalance, "insufficient credit limit");

However, when the credit account borrows the maximum limit, and time passes, the interest will accrue and make the userâ€™s borrow balance increase over the credit limit. And there is no mechanism to force the credit account to repay. The credit account cannot be liquidated.

        require(!isCreditAccount(borrower), "cannot liquidate credit account");

## Impact

The credit account can borrow more than its credit limit, which violates the rule of Iron Bank. And there is no mechanism to bring the account back to the credit limit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a penalty when the credit account has a borrow balance over the credit limit. For example, increase the borrow rate or reduce the credit limit for the account. Alternatively, allow liquidation of the credit account if it exceeds the credit limit by a certain threshold.
