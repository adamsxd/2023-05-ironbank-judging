# XDZIBEC-getPrice function does not specify the precision of the price

## Summary
- The `getPrice` function in the `PriceOracleInterface` interface does not specify the precision of the price, this means that the `getPrice` function could return a price that is not accurate, if an attacker exploit this vulnerability it's  could lead to financial loss for users.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
interface PriceOracleInterface {
    function getPrice(address asset) external view returns (uint256);
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the `PriceOracleInterface` interface, so the problem is in the return type of the `getPrice` function. the `return` type of the `getPrice` function is `uint256`, but the `getPrice` function does not specify the precision of the price. this means that the `getPrice` function could return a `price` that is not accurate.
- For example, the `getPrice` function could return a price of `1000`, but the actual price of the asset could be `1000.001`. This would result in a loss of precision, which could lead to financial loss for users.
## Impact
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability as:
   -  A user wants to buy `1000 USD` worth of an asset.
    - The user looks up the price of the asset on the` PriceOracleInterface` and sees that the price is `1000 USD`.
    - The user buys `1000 USD` worth of the asset.
    - The user later discovers that the actual price of the asset was `1000.001 USD`.
    - The user has lost `0.001 USD` due to the loss of precision.
- this vulnerability  could lead to financial loss for users.
