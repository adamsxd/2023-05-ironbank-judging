# If a market is delisted, it is impossible for a user to redeem tokens

## Summary
Iron Bank has both a `softDelist` and a `hardDelist` function with the assumption that `softDelistMarket` will be called first to allow users to withdraw and then eventually the market will be completely delisted using `hardDelistMarket`. However there is no information about how long this `softDelist` period will be. Therefore, users should have the ability to remove their assets even after the market is hard delisted. Currently, the only way for users to remove collateral from Iron Bank is through the `redeem` function, but there is a `require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");`, which will cause a revert if user's try to redeem this delisted asset. 

Although there is a `seize` function that allows an owner to transfer delisted assets, if there are thousands of liquidity suppliers, it would be up to the owner to keep track all of these and send their assets back to them manually after a delist.
## Vulnerability Detail
See summary. 
## Impact
If a market is delisted, all liquidity suppliers that didn't remove their assets during the softDelist period, will have their funds stuck.

## Recommendation
Consider adding a function that allows users to transfer assets out of Iron Bank after a market has been hard delisted.
