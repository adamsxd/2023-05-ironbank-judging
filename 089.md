# Error in calculation for increase of reserves during interest accrual

## Summary

The math for calculating the increase in reserves is wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail

In line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/IronBank.sol#L914 of `IronBank.sol` the increase of reserves (`reservesIncreased`) is calculated).

Although the correct formula for `reservesIncreased` is not documented (not in the project README.md files and no whitepaper is available) there is a high probability that the calculation is wrong. Therefore I want to point this out.

The current implementation is as follows:

```solidity
 reservesIncreased = (feeIncreased * (totalSupply + totalReserves))
                    / (totalCash + totalBorrow + (interestIncreased - feeIncreased));
```

See the "+" in front of the `(interestIncreased - feeIncreased))`? That hints that rather a "*" should be used like in the left half of the division.

A possible correction could be this on:

```solidity
 reservesIncreased = (feeIncreased * (totalSupply + totalReserves))
                    / (totalCash + totalBorrow * (interestIncreased - feeIncreased));
```

Compound uses a much simpler calculation for this: https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/a3214f67b73310d547e00fc578e8355911c9d376/contracts/CToken.sol#L362.

Since IronBank leans on Compound logic (e.g. for calculation of earned interest based on current borrow) it may be another hint that something with the calculation of `reservesIncreased` is wrong as the calculation of reserves is much more complex in IronBank.

## Impact

The caculation of fees added to reserves is incorrect. This affects the calculation of the borrow rate as it depends on the reserves which may be different than expected. The borrow rate is one of the most important factors of the IronBank math. So if that is off, lots of things will be off.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Review and fix the formula for `reservesIncreased`. Also, please add documentation on why the calculations are done like they are done. For an audit this would have been important to have to check protocol math against a reference.
