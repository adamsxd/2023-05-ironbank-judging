# XDZIBEC-sqrtPriceLimitX96 Parameter Not Checked for Zero in quoteExactOutputSingle() Function

## Summary
The `sqrtPriceLimitX96` parameter in the `quoteExactOutputSingle()` function is not checked for zero. This means that an attacker could specify a zero price limit, which would cause the function to return an incorrect amount. This could lead to the user losing money or receiving less than they expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function quoteExactOutputSingle(
        address tokenIn,
        address tokenOut,
        uint24 fee,
        uint256 amountOut,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96
    ) external returns (uint256 amountIn);
}
```
there is a vulnerability in the `quoteExactOutputSingle()` function. The function does not check to make sure that the `sqrtPriceLimitX96` parameter is not zero this means that an attacker could specify a zero price limit, which would cause the function to return an incorrect `amount`.
## Impact
- An attacker could  cause financial loss to the user from exploiting the vulnerability.
-  an attacker could specify a zero price limit when trying to swap 1 `ETH` for 100 `USDC`. The function would return an incorrect amount of `USDC`, which would result in the attacker losing money.

## Recommendation
-  the `sqrtPriceLimitX96` parameter should be checked to make sure that it is not zero.
