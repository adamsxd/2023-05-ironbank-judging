# XDZIBEC-createAndInitializePoolIfNecessary() Function Does Not Check for Valid Addresses

## Summary
The `createAndInitializePoolIfNecessary()` function in the `IPoolInitializer` interface does not check to make sure that the `token0` and `token1` parameters are valid addresses, this means that an attacker could specify invalid addresses, which would cause the function to fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
interface IPoolInitializer {
    /// @notice Creates a new pool if it does not exist, then initializes if not initialized
    /// @dev This method can be bundled with others via IMulticall for the first action (e.g. mint) performed against a pool
    /// @param token0 The contract address of token0 of the pool
    /// @param token1 The contract address of token1 of the pool
    /// @param fee The fee amount of the v3 pool for the specified token pair
    /// @param sqrtPriceX96 The initial square root price of the pool as a Q64.96 value
    /// @return pool Returns the pool address based on the pair of tokens and fee, will return the newly created pool address if necessary
    function createAndInitializePoolIfNecessary(
        address token0,
        address token1,
        uint24 fee,
        uint160 sqrtPriceX96
    ) external payable returns (address pool);
}
```
-The vulnerability is  in the `IPoolInitializer` interface, The `createAndInitializePoolIfNecessary()` function does not check to make sure that the `token0` and `token1` parameters are valid addresses, means that, an attacker could specify the address of a non-existent token contract for the token0 parameter. This would cause the function to fail and no pool would be created
## Impact
- an attacker attacker could specify invalid addresses, which would cause the function to fail.
- the vulnerability gone be exploited as flow:
    - An attacker creates a contract with the `IPoolInitializern` iterface.
    - The attacker specifies invalid addresses for the `token0` and `token1` parameters when calling the `createAndInitializePoolIfNecessary()` function.
    - The function will fail and no pool will be created.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `token0` and `token1` parameters could be checked to make sure that they are contracts. this would prevent an attacker from specifying addresses that do not represent `tokens`.
- The `createPool()` function could be checked to make sure that it succeeds. this would prevent an attacker from creating a pool that does not exist.
