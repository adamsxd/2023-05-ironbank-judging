# anyone can transferIBToken dust for another user on all markets to increase another user's gas cost for executing liquidity check

## Summary
anyone can transferIBToken dust for another user on all markets to increase another user's gas cost for executing liquidity check

## Vulnerability Detail
On IronBank, anyone can transferIBToken 1wei for another users across all markets to make another user "enter market". After entering market the attacked user would have to loop through the list of allEnteredMarkets during `borrow`, `redeem`, all of which would rely on _checkAccountLiquidity to ensure proper collaterialization.

_transferIBToken
```solidity
    function _transferIBToken(address market, DataTypes.Market storage m, address from, address to, uint256 amount)
        internal
    {
        require(from != address(0), "transfer from the zero address");
        require(to != address(0), "transfer to the zero address");

        uint256 fromBalance = m.userSupplies[from];
        require(amount > 0, "transfer zero amount");
        require(fromBalance >= amount, "transfer amount exceeds balance");

        _enterMarket(market, to);
```

_enterMarket
```solidity
    function _enterMarket(address market, address user) internal {
        if (enteredMarkets[user][market]) {
            // Skip if user has entered the market.
            return;
        }

        enteredMarkets[user][market] = true;
        allEnteredMarkets[user].push(market);

        emit MarketEntered(market, user);
    }
```

## Impact
increased gas cost for attacked user.
