# Borrower Can Avoid Liquidation by Creating a Large `allEnteredMarkets` Array Size

## Summary

The borrower can prevent liquidation by increasing the size of the `allEnteredMarkets` array. Since the `_isLiquidatable()` function iterates over the borrower's `allEnteredMarkets` array. If the size of the array becomes too large, it can reach the block gas limit and cause the transaction to be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. In the `IronBank` contract, the attacker has supplied some market and calls `borrow()` function borrows any asset available in the market.

2. The attacker calls the `supply()` function to provide market tokens to the `IronBank` contract.

3. This will trigger the execution of the `_enterMarket()` function. If the user has not entered the market yet, this function will push the market address to the `allEnteredMarkets` array for the attacker.

```solidity=!
function _enterMarket(address market, address user) internal {
    if (enteredMarkets[user][market]) {
        // Skip if user has entered the market.
        return;
    }

    enteredMarkets[user][market] = true;
    allEnteredMarkets[user].push(market);

    emit MarketEntered(market, user);
}
```

4. By repeating steps 2 and 3 with different markets, the attacker can significantly increase the size of their `allEnteredMarkets` array.

5. Due to the large size of the attacker's `allEnteredMarkets` array, the `_isLiquidatable()` function cannot be executed efficiently because it would involve iterating over the attacker's `allEnteredMarkets` array, potentially reaching the block gas limit and cause the transaction to be reverted.

```solidity=!
function _isLiquidatable(address user) internal view returns (bool) {
    uint256 liquidationCollateralValue;
    uint256 debtValue;

    address[] memory userEnteredMarkets = allEnteredMarkets[user];
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < userEnteredMarkets.length; i++) {
```

6. Making it impossible to liquidate the attacker's borrowed assets without incurring significant gas costs.

## Impact

Malicious actor can avoid being liquidated.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Limit the number of markets that a user can enter to prevent the gas required from exceeding the block gas limit.
