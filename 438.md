# Missing Slippage and Deadline control on `Supply` and `Redeem` function

## Summary

Missing Slippage and Deadline control on `Supply` and `Redeem` function

## Vulnerability Detail

When users attempt to supply or redeem assets on IronBank without implementing slippage control or considering the minimum expected return of IBTokens corresponding to the provided amount, they may encounter unfavorable outcomes. This is due to the fact that the calculation of the Exchange Rate is depends on the supply amount, which can lead to potential inflation or deflation of the token's value. As a result, users may receive a suboptimal return on their transactions.

In supply function the ibToken amount is directly calculated related to `_getExchangeRate`, which depends on direct `totalSupply`

```js
File: IronBank.sol
306:     function supply(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
307:         external
308:         nonReentrant
309:         isAuthorized(from)
310:     {
...
323:         uint256 ibTokenAmount = (amount * 1e18) / _getExchangeRate(m);
...
342:     }
...
...
805:     function _getExchangeRate(DataTypes.Market storage m) internal view returns (uint256) {
806:         uint256 totalSupplyPlusReserves = m.totalSupply + m.totalReserves;
807:         if (totalSupplyPlusReserves == 0) {
808:             return m.config.initialExchangeRate;
809:         }
810:         return ((m.totalCash + m.totalBorrow) * 1e18) / totalSupplyPlusReserves;
811:     }
```

When users attempt to submit a supply (or redeem) transaction with a specified gas price, they may encounter delays if a sudden spike in gas prices occurs. Subsequently, upon confirmation, if the transaction is validated and there are changes in the underlying supply that negatively impact the user's position, it can result in adverse consequences for the user. Implementing slippage and deadline controls in such situations can mitigate these risks and protect users from potential losses.

To safeguard users from potential losses, it is essential to incorporate slippage and deadline controls in both inbound and outbound functions. By implementing slippage control, the protocol can mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations, reducing the likelihood of users incurring substantial losses.

Additionally, incorporating deadline controls ensures that transactions are executed within a specified timeframe, preventing the execution of outdated or unfavorable trades. These measures collectively aim to protect users and minimize the possibility of negative outcomes.

## Impact

Without a deadline check, supply/redeem transactions can be executed against the user's interest. Lack of slippage check allows transactions to proceed unfavorably without reverting.

```js
File: IronBank.sol
306:     function supply(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
307:         external
308:         nonReentrant
309:         isAuthorized(from)
...
406:     function redeem(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
407:         external
408:         nonReentrant
409:         isAuthorized(from)
```

## Recommendation

Implement slippage and deadline control on the inbound and outbound function so user might not get wracked
