# User can steal ETH that is stuck in contract which should be retrieved by the owner

## Summary
The TxBuilderExtension contract allows an attacker to abuse the `execute` function to steal the Ether that is stuck within the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `execute` function in the TxBuilderExtension contract is a publicly accessible function that allows external callers to execute a series of actions. It takes an array of Action as input and invokes the internal `executeInternal` function.
The `executeInternal` function handles the execution of individual actions within the execute function. It iterates over the array of Action structures and performs different actions based on the name field of each Action.

However, let's assume that there is 1 ETH in the TxBuilderExtension contract.
1. Attacker calls TxBuilderExtension.execute with two calls to supplyNativeToken and send along 1 ETH.
2. Since there is 1 additional ETH in the contract, both calls succeed, leaving 0 ETH in the contract. Thereby the attacker has stolen the 1 ETH which only the owner should be able to rescue.

Stucked ETH can also be used for repaying position, using `repayNativeToken`.


**Note**: The same issue applies to similar functionality in the `UniswapExtension` contract.

## Impact
Attacker can steal the ETH from the TxBuilderExtension contract that should only be accessible for the owner of the contract.
