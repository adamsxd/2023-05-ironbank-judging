# Chainlink's `latestRoundData` might return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
Chainlink's `latestRoundData` function is used but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:

- https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getPriceFromChainlink`  and `_setAggregators` functions from PriceOracle contract uses Chainlink's latestRoundData() to get the latest price. However, there is no check if the return value indicates stale data.

## Impact
No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. The functions rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, what can lead to fund loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding checks for stale data.
```solidity
(uint80 roundId, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);

require(price > 0, "invalid price");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Price stale");
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < PRICE_ORACLE_STALE_THRESHOLD, "Price round incomplete");
```
