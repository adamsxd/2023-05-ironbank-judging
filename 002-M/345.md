# Missing checks for whether L2 Sequencer is active

## Summary
Missing checks for whether L2 Sequencer is active
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol intends to deploy to optimism & arbtrium as well apart from Ethereum.
Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the L2 sequencer is active
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds
If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.
## Impact
Stale prices, e.g. if USDC were to de-peg while the sequencer is offline, stale price is used and can result in false liquidation or over-borrowing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
