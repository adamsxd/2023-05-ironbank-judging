# Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Summary

Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active or not in the `getPriceFromChainlink()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue occurs in the `getPriceFromChainlink()` function below :

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

Because the protocol will be deployed on the arbtrium chain, Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active or not

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds

The function `getPriceFromChainlink()` is used inside the function `getPrice()` which in turn is used by the IronBank contract to get the collateral value of the users and to check if they are liquidatable or not.

So If the sequencer goes down, the oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed, and thus the `getPriceFromChainlink()` returns a stale/wrong price this can potentially cause a loss of funds and will have a negative impact on the protocol :

- Some users will not be able to borrow when they are supposed to be able to.

- Some users will be set as liquidatable (or not liquidatable) when they are supposed to be solvent (not solvent).

## Impact

If the sequencer goes down, the oracles may return stale prices, which can result in false liquidation or over-borrowing in the IronBank contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow iron bank operations (borrow, liquidation,...) to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
