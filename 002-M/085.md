# getPriceFromChainlink() doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in PriceOracle.sol

## Summary
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down.

The sequencer being down has happened in the past - [Arbitrum sequencer suffers 10 hours outage](https://thedefiant.io/arbitrum-outage-2)

This will lead to wrong prices and malicious actors potentially exploiting the protocol and the users.
## Vulnerability Detail
The required check to make sure the sequencer is active is not present in the code
```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
``` 
## Impact
This may result in an unexpected price if the sequencer is down, opening the possibility for malicious actors to exploit the protocol.

## Recommendation
Implement a method to check if the sequencer is down. Follow the Chainlink docs for dealing with EVM chains: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code
