# Improper oracle integration due to lack of accounting for sequencer downtime for L2 chains

## Summary

There is a lack of handling the case when the sequencer for the L2s that Iron Bank is released on are down, which can result in users unfairly losing funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Iron Bank will be released on multiple L2s, wherein it is important to check for whether the sequencer is down. If the sequencer is down, users of the lending protocol will be unable to e.g. save their positions if the price has changed significantly during that downtime, leading to unfair liquidations once the sequencer goes back up. The current implementation of the PriceOracle contract does not check whether the sequencer is down.

## Impact

Lack of checking if the sequencer is down can result in unfair behavior of the protocol, that can lead to loss of funds for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `PriceOracle` contract similar to what is laid out here: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/ so that it: (1) checks whether the sequencer is up and (2) if the sequencer has gone down, revert for a specified grace period.
