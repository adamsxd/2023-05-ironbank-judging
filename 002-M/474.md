# L2 sequencer Downtime

## Summary
The Iron Bank Protocol is to deploy on Arbitrum, Optimism and Mainnet. On L2s like Arbitrum  and Optimism, the Sequencer which feeds prices have downtimes. This leads to stale prices being fed into the protocol, even if they are checked. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If the Arbitrum Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle.
But there is no check here..

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Get price from Chainlink.
     * @param base The base asset
     * @param quote The quote asset
     * @return The price
     */
    function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }
```
## Impact
This impacts all functions that interact directly with the price oracle. 
The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.
