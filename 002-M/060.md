# getPriceFromChainlink() doesn't check if sequencer for Arbitum/Optimism is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
The project stated, that they want to deploy the contract on Arbitrum and Optimism. When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains,  one must ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. If this happens a malicious actor can get a unfair advantage.


## Vulnerability Detail

In the function getPriceFromChainlink() there is no check if the sequencer provides fresh data or not

`function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");

        // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
    }`

## Impact
could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
