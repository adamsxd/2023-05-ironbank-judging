# Lack of sequencer uptime check when getting oracle data for Arbitrum or Optimism

## Summary

When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum or Optimism, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `getPrice` function in `PriceOracle.sol` contract is used to get the price using the Chainlink Registry but is not checking if the sequencer is up or down if the contract is used in Optimism or Arbitrum. 

Chainlink recommends checking whether the Arbitrum or Optimism sequencer is active, when using oracle prices.

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds

If the sequencer is down, oracles may return stale prices and versions, as transactions submitted to L2 (for example by aggregating oracles) will not be processed until the sequencer comes back online, while users still have a way to submit transactions to the L2 using delayed inbox.

## Impact

This issue could potentially be exploited by malicious actors in times when the L2 sequencer is down.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use sequencer oracle to determine if sequencer is active or not and prevent executing trades during sequencer downtime.
