# PriceOracle#getPriceFromChainlink fails to check Arbitrum/Optimism Sequencer uptime

## Summary

Chainlink oracles should never be used on L2 such as Arbitrum or Optimism without validating the sequencer uptime. In the event that the sequencer goes down real asset price will continue to change, leading to a host of problems. Full information and rational as to why this should be implemented can be found directly from Chainlink [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds).

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary

## Impact

Large scale unfair liquidations in the event that the sequencer goes down

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Implement a check and grace period as recommend by Chainlink when consuming L2 oracle data
