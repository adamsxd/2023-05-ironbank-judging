# Missing check for whether L2 Sequencer is active

## Summary

When using chainlink price oracles, whether L2 Sequencer is active should be checked. Or we will get a stale price if the sequencer is down.

## Vulnerability Detail

The price oracle does not check whether the sequencer is active or not.

```solidity
function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}
```

## Impact

When the sequencer is down, the oracle can have a stale price. The attacker can borrow with a stale price to profit and leave a bad debt.

When the market suffer large price changes, the traffic on chain are usually congested. The possiblity of L2 sequencer offline is higher than usual. When this situation happens the protocol could go bankrupt. For a borrowing system like this, the oracle should be the most robust so I ranked this as high severity.

Follow the instructions in [chainlink's doc](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) to corretly checking sequencer status.
