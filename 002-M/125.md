# Chainlink's L2 sequencer is not checked if it is down

## Summary
When Chainlink is used in L2 chains such as Arbitrum and Optimism, it is required to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.

## Vulnerability Detail
Iron Bank protocol is going to be deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism.
Issue is that `PriceOracle` contract uses Chainlink and on L2 chains like Arbitrum and Optimism, it is required to have checks on the Chainlink's L2 sequencer, but that is not being done in the current `PriceOracle`

## Impact
`PriceOracle.getPrice` function could be potentially exploited by malicious users to gain unfair advantage (`IronBank.sol` for example)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a different `PriceOracle` contract that is meant to be deployed on Arbitrum and Optimisim, which is going to check L2 sequencer before fetching `latestRoundData`
