# Chainlink's Feed Registry is not supported in Arbitrum and Optimism leads to manipulating by admin/owner

## Summary

Chainlink's Feed Registry is not supported in Arbitrum and Optimism leads to manipulating by admin/owner

## Vulnerability Detail

Since Chainlink's Feed Registry is not supported in Arbitrum and Optimism, the Iron Bank team have to make customize Feed Registry Contracts of its own, but it will not ensure that the contracts are navigating to the right Chainlink's Feed Registry contracts.

## Impact

It can lead to manipulation by the admin/owner who can config Price Feed addresses in the customize Feed Registry Contract. Therefore, the admin/owner can just update the right Chainlink's Feed Registry to the malicious contract in order to change the price what ever they want.
Moreover, they can drain all the markets by doing this:
 - Step 1: find the lowest value market and supply it some amount
 - Step 2: change price of that market high to the roof, and then change others as low as possible. This will make almost every users can be liquidate.
 - Step 3: liquidate everyone
