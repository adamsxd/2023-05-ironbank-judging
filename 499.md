# `ironBank.accrueInterest` is not called when calling the `getSupplyBalance` and `getBorrowBalance`

## Summary

Prior to calling the `getSupplyBalance`, the function  `accrueInterest` should be called. This is done in order to use the accumulated value by considering the interest accrued for the particular duration.

We can see this, and the contract has done it in many places, except in few locations.

## Vulnerability Detail

when redeeming the native token, contract calls the `getSupplyBalance` incase of full redeem.

The function `getSupplyBalance` is called without calling the` accrueInterest`. This would lead to calculating the lesser redeem amount than the original value.

    function redeemNativeToken(address user, uint256 redeemAmount) internal nonReentrant {
        if (redeemAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            redeemAmount = ironBank.getSupplyBalance(user, weth);
        }
        ironBank.redeem(user, address(this), weth, redeemAmount);
        WethInterface(weth).withdraw(redeemAmount);
        (bool sent,) = user.call{value: redeemAmount}("");
        require(sent, "failed to send native token");

## Impact

Lesser amount calculation than what is actually it should be.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call the accrueinterset function. before calling the Supply balance and borrow balance.
