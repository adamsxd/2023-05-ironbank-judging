# Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Summary
PriceOracle doesn't check whether the Arbitrum Sequencer is active when using prices from chainlink oracle.
## Vulnerability Detail
Iron Bank protocol is going to launch on arbitrum network.
PriceOracle is using chainlink oracle in order to get prices. Chainlink recommends to check if arbitrum sequencer [is active](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum) in order to get fresh prices. Otherwise stale prices can be fetched.
## Impact
PriceOracle can calculate prices incorrectly which can cause bad debt for a protocol.

## Recommendation
Check that sequencer is not down.
