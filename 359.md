# USDT needs safeApprove(0) before setting a new approval

## Summary

Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value.They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved

## Vulnerability Detail

In FlashLoan.sol, we are approving type(uint256).max when repaying the tokens that we borrowed. However, there are some tokens like USDT that dont allow to approve allowance from non-zero value to non-zero value. So if you try to approve a non-zero value when it already had allowance, the tx will fail. In the _loan() function, it will approve the max value every time this function is called, so  the second time it will fail. 

## Impact

The tx will fail if you have already set the allowance to the contract before. The function approves the max value every time this function is called, so the second time it will fail

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/flashLoan/FlashLoan.sol#L108

```solidity

function _loan(IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver, address token, uint256 amount, bytes memory data, address msgSender)
        internal
    {
        IronBankInterface(ironBank).borrow(address(this), address(receiver), token, amount);

        require(receiver.onFlashLoan(msgSender, token, amount, 0, data) == CALLBACK_SUCCESS, "callback failed"); // no fee

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(address(receiver), address(this), amount);

        uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), ironBank);
        if (allowance < amount) {
            IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
        }

        IronBankInterface(ironBank).repay(address(this), address(this), token, amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider setting the allowance to 0 before the max value so that the tx doesnt fail

```solidity
if (allowance < amount) {
     IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, 0);
     IERC20(token).safeApprove(ironBank, type(uint256).max);
 }
```
