# `accrueInterest` method is not called before updating `reserveFactor` of a market

## Summary
In the `softDelistMarket` method, the `accrueInterest` method is not called before updating the `reserveFactor` of a market's configuration.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function, `adjustMarketReserveFactor` we see that the function `accrueInterest` is called before the reserve factor is updated to a new value. This is done to conclude the current accumulated interest with the original reserve factor. This logic is also seen in `changeMarketInterestRateModel`.

But, in the `softDelistMarket` method we do not call the `accrueInterest` method before updating the `reserveFactor` to `MAX_RESERVE_FACTOR`.

## Impact
If `accrueInterest` is not called, the accumulated interest with the previous reserve factor is not taken into account.

## Code Snippet
In [`softDelistMarket`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/pool/MarketConfigurator.sol#L282): 

```solidity
    function softDelistMarket(address market) external onlyOwner {
        DataTypes.MarketConfig memory config = getMarketConfiguration(market);
        require(config.isListed, "not listed");

        if (!config.isSupplyPaused()) {
            config.setSupplyPaused(true);
            emit MarketPausedSet(market, "supply", true);
        }
        if (!config.isBorrowPaused()) {
            config.setBorrowPaused(true);
            emit MarketPausedSet(market, "borrow", true);
        }
        if (config.reserveFactor != MAX_RESERVE_FACTOR) {
            config.reserveFactor = MAX_RESERVE_FACTOR;
            emit MarketReserveFactorSet(market, MAX_RESERVE_FACTOR);
        }
        ironBank.setMarketConfiguration(market, config);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please update the code so that the `accrueInterest` method is called before updating the `reserveFactor` variable.
