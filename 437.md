# `repay()` and `redeem()` functions are accessible at all times, even when borrowing, supplying and IB token Transfer functionalities may be in a paused state.

## Summary

`repay()` and `redeem()` functions are accessible at all times, even when borrowing, supplying and IB token Transfer functionalities may be in a paused state.

## Vulnerability Detail

IronBank has implemented PauseFlags to address potential extreme market conditions, such as exploits or legal requirements. These flags enable the protocol to pause the supply, borrow, and transfer functionalities of IBTokens.

However, it seems that the `repay()` and `redeem()` functions are not included in this pause mechanism. The protocol lacks the ability to pause repayments and redeems, whether it is for the full amount or partial.

In most protocols, the pause mechanism typically involves temporarily restricting both inbound and outbound interactions with the protocol to maintain control. However, in the case of IronBank, only the inbound access is limited while the outbound access remains open. This configuration can lead to potential failures if the pause functionality is triggered under specific conditions, as it fails to fully restrict outgoing activities and maintain complete control over the protocol.

## Impact

The protocol lacks the capability to halt the outflow of collateral or interrupt the repayment and redeem flow, as the repay and redeem function remains open and operational despite the necessity to stop these activities.

```js
File: IronBank.sol
406:     function redeem(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
407:         external
408:         nonReentrant
409:         isAuthorized(from)
410:     {
411:         DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
412:         require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
413:
..
449:
450:         emit Redeem(market, from, to, amount, ibTokenAmount);
451:     }
...
460:     function repay(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(from) {
461:         DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
462:         require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
...
470:     }
```

## Recommendation

Implement a pause mechanism on outbound (repay and redeem)
