# Any user is able to mint PTokens for free

## Summary
If the PBToken contract holds a quantity of `underlaying` tokens which is larger that the `totalSupply` of the PToken any user can mint free PTokens for free.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PToken.sol` contract implements and `absorb` function which is defined in the following way:

```solidity
function absorb(address user) public {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 amount = balance - totalSupply();
        _mint(user, amount);
}
```

The function works as following: `amount` is calculated as `balance - totalSupply()` and `balance` is `uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this))`. This means that if the balance of the underlying token in the contract is greather that the totalSupply of the PToken, the difference amount is minted to `user`.

The NatSpec comments clearly state that not every user should be able to call the `absorb` function but only contracts:

`* @dev This function should only be called by contracts.`

But there are no modifiers or checks implemented on the function, therefore any user can call to the `absorb` function at any time and getting free PTokens is `amount` results positive.

## Impact
Any user can call to the `absorb` function at any time and getting free PTokens is `amount` results positive.

## Recommendation
Implement a modifier or a `require` statment that checks if the caller is an allowed contract.
