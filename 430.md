# Borrowers can manipulate the protocol in order to minimize the interest accrued on their borrow balance

## Summary

Borrowers can manipulate the protocol in order to minimize the interest accrued on their borrow balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user borrows from IronBank, they will have their own `borrowBalance` and `borrowIndex` data. To accrue and update interest, IronBank will call `_accrueInterest` for a market globally, which will affecting the global market `borrowIndex` and this will be used to calculate user's borrow in `_getBorrowBalance`.

The `_accrueInterest()` will increase global market's borrowIndex while on `_getBorrowBalance` the denominator, user's borrowIndex is only being updated on `borrow()` and `_repay()` function.

The `borrow()` and `repay()` function include `amount` parameter which still callable if this `amount` is 0. This resulting a user can keep up their borrowIndex with market's borrowIndex by just calling `borrow` or `repay` with zero amount frequently.

by default if user (borrower) only do a common path, they will `borrow()` at X, and `repay()` at Y, and the diff between `Y` & `X` is accounted as interest accumulation time, which is what the `borrowIndex` is intended to.

The `borrowBalance` calculation `(b.borrowBalance * m.borrowIndex) / b.borrowIndex;` assume the `m.borrowIndex` will increase while the `b.borrowIndex` will just updated when user is starting and ending their borrow action.

if the `m.borrowIndex` and `b.borrowIndex` is almost equal, then the `b.borrowBalance` will be multiplied with ~1. Thus, user will pay less interest. Thus, the more frequent calls, the less interest they will need to pay.

## Impact

When borrowers take actions to minimize their borrowing interest, it can result in a reduction of revenue for the protocol.

```solidity
File: IronBank.sol
846:     function _getBorrowBalance(DataTypes.Market storage m, address user) internal view returns (uint256) {
847:         DataTypes.UserBorrow memory b = m.userBorrows[user];
848:
849:         if (b.borrowBalance == 0) {
850:             return 0;
851:         }
852:
853:         // borrowBalanceWithInterests = borrowBalance * marketBorrowIndex / userBorrowIndex
854:         return (b.borrowBalance * m.borrowIndex) / b.borrowIndex;
855:     }
```

## Recommendation

Consider reassessing the interest mechanism or implementing safeguards to protect the `borrow(`) and `repay()` functions, ensuring that the effort and outcomes involved in these operations are not susceptible to exploitation or abuse.
