# Users cannot be liquidated if there is no cash in the market they used for collateral

## Summary

If a market cannot send the amount of collateral a liquidator is owed the liquidation will revert and the user that should be liquidatable cannot be liquidated


## Vulnerability Detail

When liquidating a borrower, the liquidator repays the borrowerâ€™s debt and receives collateral worth the repaid debt * `liquidationBonus`.  If the market the liquidated user used for collateral does not have enough cash/underlying/collateral anymore because it all was borrowed by other users, the liquidation will revert. This results in users that should be liquidated but can not be liquidated.   


## Impact

If a market has not enough cash to ensure the liquidators get the collateral they are owed from liquidation, the liquidations will revert, and the bank might be stuck with a lot of bad debt if the value of the underlying continues to fall and no one repays debt or deposits into the market to enable liquidations again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

By adding a threshold to the market of how much of the supplied underlying can be borrowed, this risk can be reduced. E.g. only 90% of all deposits can be borrowed. This would not eliminate the risk 100%  since the remaining 10% of underlying could still be redeemed or withdrawn by liquidation but it would offer a buffer for such scenarios.
