# A user can redeem some lend token which he shouldn't after that he can liqudiate himself.

## Summary
Protocol take security for immidiate liqudiate for giving differant threshold for _CheckAccountLiqudity and isLiqudatable by this way a borrower cannot make his account liqudatable with his hand accidently or purposely. Also, protocol reward liqudator with give bonus when calculate ratio. So if a borrower can use liqudiate himself instead of repay, he can take his lending tokens with pay less borrow token. In short a borrower cannot make himself liqudatable by his hand and protocol try to prevent this by check different levels of ratio when calculate for borrow&reddem amd liqudiate. However when redeem just accrue lended token and user can reddem more token than he should because his borrowed amount dont increase and protocol calculate his account liquidity ratio high than supposed to. After redeem there is a chance to his account liqudatable when accrueInterest use to borrow token and he can use liqudiate for his account with another account (aka sybil attack) so he pay less borrow token for take all of his lend token with liqudiate bonus and there is stuck some borrow amount to protocol normally it shouldn't for in that market situation.
## Vulnerability Detail
Poc steps are:
1)User lend and borrow one token with lowest ratio he can.
2)Use redeem function for himself after some time in that function protocol dont calculate borrow interest and he can reddem more token than he should.
3) Due to this unpredicted redeemed token amount his account become liquidatable and he liqudate his account with differant account.(Normally he will not be liqudatable because protocol dont allow him to reddem token.)
4) There is left some borrow amount for his account and 0 lending token.Normally if he want to take all l-his lending token he should repay all of borrow token and his account become 0 lend and 0 borrow token.    
## Impact
A malicious user can left some bad token for protocol in purpose.
