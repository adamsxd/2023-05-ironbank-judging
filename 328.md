# If user had became a credit user after he supplied and borrowed, it is hard for him to repay and redeem

## Summary
If user had became a credit user after he supplied and borrowed, it is hard for him to repay and redeem.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user will supply 1000USDT and he will borrow 100Dai to the different "to" address to buy some thing. After that, let's assume that Admin will set credit limit to him.
As he doesn't need to have collateral balance, he will try to repay (100Dai) from "to" address to his "from" address in order to redeem his collateral (1000USDT).

```solidity
	function repay(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant isAuthorized(from) {
		DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
		require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");
		if (isCreditAccount(to)) {
			require(from == to, "credit account can only repay for itself");
		}

		_accrueInterest(market, m);

		_repay(m, from, to, market, amount);
	}
```

But it will be reverted because "from" is different with "to", as he is a credit user.
Let's assume that user will try to redeem even though he didn't repay his borrow balance.

```solidity
	function redeem(address from, address to, address market, uint256 amount)
		external
		nonReentrant
		isAuthorized(from)
	{
		DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
		require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

		_accrueInterest(market, m);
		...
		
		IBTokenInterface(m.config.ibTokenAddress).burn(from, ibTokenAmount); // Only emits Transfer event.
		IERC20(market).safeTransfer(to, amount);

		_checkAccountLiquidity(from);

		emit Redeem(market, from, to, amount, ibTokenAmount);
	}
```

He can't redeem his supply by "_checkAccountLiquidity", as an "insufficient collateral" reason, because he still has borrowed balance.
In order to repay his borrow balance, he should transfer his borrowed balance (100Dai) to his "from" address manually, and repay with same addresses (to == from). This not only consumes gas for the user but also annoys him.

## Impact
If user had became a credit user after he supplied and borrowed, he won't repay his borrowed balance with different addresses, as well as redeem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Actually, a credit user doesn't need to supply for collateral money, that's why it should be reverted if user has some entered markets before he is a credit user, when admin sets credit limit to an user.

```solidity
	function setCreditLimit(address user, address market, uint256 credit) external onlyCreditLimitManager {
		DataTypes.Market storage m = markets[market];
		require(m.config.isListed, "not listed");

		require(isCreditAccount(user) || allEnteredMarkets[user].length == 0, "user has some entered markets");

		if (credit == 0 && creditLimits[user][market] != 0) {
			allCreditMarkets[user].deleteElement(market);
		} else if (credit != 0 && creditLimits[user][market] == 0) {
			allCreditMarkets[user].push(market);
		}

		creditLimits[user][market] = credit;
		emit CreditLimitChanged(user, market, credit);
	}
```
