# Oracle is not checking for sequencer uptime when IronBank deployed on Arbitrum

## Summary

Oracle is not checking for sequencer uptime when IronBank deployed on Arbitrum

## Vulnerability Detail

IronBank will also be deployed to L2 Arbitrum, and due to the functionality of Arbitrum, even if the Layer 2 (L2) network goes offline, transactions can still be sent through the Delayed inbox on Layer 1 (L1). This mechanism can potentially enable the creation of orders that rely on prices from a period when the Sequencer was inactive. Although these orders may pass the freshness check, they could contain incorrect or outdated pricing information.

## Impact

Stale prices, possible order execution could have an incorrect pricing outcome.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank/blob/main/ib-v2/src/protocol/oracle/PriceOracle.sol#L66-L72

```js
File: PriceOracle.sol
66:     function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
67:         (, int256 price,,,) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
68:         require(price > 0, "invalid price");
69:
70:         // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
71:         return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
72:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the check for the Sequencer being online, see the Chainlink docs for more details:
