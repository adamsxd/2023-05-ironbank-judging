# PriceOracle.sol will not work on Optimism & Arbitrum network

## Summary
The current implementation of PriceOracle.sol will not work on Optimism & Arbitrum network.

## Vulnerability Detail
The implementation of PriceOracle.sol relies on the existence of Chainlink's FeedRegistry, which is currently only available on Ethereum mainnet.

## Impact
- Price oracle will not work as is. It'll require a new implementation that requires manual setup for each aggregator source.
- The protocol will not function correctly without the price oracle.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- For Optimism & Arbitrum, have a different implementation that doesn't rely on the FeedRegistry, e.g. by having a mapping from token address you want to query to map to the aggregator price source.
