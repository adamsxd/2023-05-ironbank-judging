# Credit accounts in a market being hard-delisted remain as credit accounts forever

## Summary
Credit accounts in hard-delisted markets remain as credit accounts forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a market is hard-delisted, it does not remove the market address from `allCreditMarkets` which represents credit markets for an account.
Thus, `isCreditAccount` for those accounts always return true unless the credit manager manually iterate through those accounts to set their credit limit to 0.
However, `IronBank` does not provide a function that returns credit accounts for a specific market, so the credit manager has no way to get all credit accounts for hard-delisted market. 

## Impact
Because of the vulnerability, a non-credit account will be regarded as credit account that will result in opposite operation in many functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I can think of two different mitigations.

1. Add a new state variable `marketCreditUsers` that stores an array of credit accounts per market. And then iterate through those accounts in `hardDelistMarket` function and take appropriate actions. (Not recommended because it will cost tons of gas when there's a lot of credit accounts)
2. Add a timestamp or auto-increasing number that is updated whenever a market is hard-delisted and then a map(address => uint256) that keeps track of timestamp for each account to update `allCreditMarkets`.
