# XDZIBEC-Incorrect Length Parameter Validation in toAsciiString() Function

## Summary
 - The `toAsciiString()` function in the `AddressStringUtil` library has a vulnerability that can cause incorrect output for addresses with more than `16` bytes. This bug could lead to problems for users who are trying to interact with contracts that use the `toAsciiString()` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function toAsciiString(address addr, uint256 len) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        require(len % 2 == 0 && len > 0 && len <= 40, 'AddressStringUtil: INVALID_LEN');

        bytes memory s = new bytes(len);
        uint256 addrNum = uint256(uint160(addr));
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
            // shift right and truncate all but the least significant byte to extract the byte at position 19-i
            uint8 b = uint8(addrNum >> (8 * (19 - i)));
            // first hex character is the most significant 4 bits
            uint8 hi = b >> 4;
            // second hex character is the least significant 4 bits
            uint8 lo = b - (hi << 4);
            s[2 * i] = char(hi);
            s[2 * i + 1] = char(lo);
        }
        return string(s);
    }
```
- There is a vulnerability in the t`oAsciiString()` function, especially in the line `uint8 hi = b >> 4; ` the problem is that the `b` variable is only `8` bits wide, so the right-shift operation will always truncate the most significant 4 bits. This means that the `hi` variable will always be between `0` and `15`. 
This can lead varios problems: 
-  The `toAsciiString()` function will not produce the correct output for addresses that have more than `16` bytes.
-  The `toAsciiString()` function will be vulnerable to attack if an attacker can provide an address that has more than `16` bytes.
## Impact
- If an attacker exploit this vulnerability :
  - it's gine send tokens to an address that has more than 16 bytes. The `toAsciiString()` function would produce an incorrect output for the address, and the tokens would be sent to the wrong address.
  - Interact with a contract that uses the `toAsciiString()` function. The `toAsciiString()` function would produce an incorrect output for the address, and the attacker could lose funds or have their data tampered with.
  - Create a fake address that looks like a valid address. The `toAsciiString()` function would produce an incorrect output for the fake address, and the attacker could trick users into sending tokens or data to the fake addres

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- can be fixed this vulnerability changing this : `uint8 hi = b >> 4;` to this `uint8 hi = b >> 4 & 0xf;` this will ensure that the hi variable. is always between 0 and 15.
